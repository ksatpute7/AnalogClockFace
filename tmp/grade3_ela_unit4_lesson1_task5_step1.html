As you read your piece, be on the lookout for the features<strong>&nbsp;</strong>we have learned about: setting, narrator, characters, events, and problem/solution. </p><p>Now, begin completing your personal graphic organizer. Refer to the chart the class completed in the last task to help you with your work. When you have done as much as you can, swap Cold Writes with your partner. Give each other feedback and help to complete your graphic organizer.</p><p>Use these questions to guide you.</p><div class="panel"><ul><li>What features do you notice in your piece?</li><li>Is there a clear setting<strong>&nbsp;</strong>(time <em>and</em> place) in your piece? If not, decide on one now and add it in. </li><li>What about characters? Are all the characters important to the story? Did you include all the important characters? </li><li>What are the main events?<strong>&nbsp;</strong>What is the order of<strong>&nbsp;</strong>events? </li></ul></div><p> You and your partner can revise these features<strong>&nbsp;</strong>together.</p>
