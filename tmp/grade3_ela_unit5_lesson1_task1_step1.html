                        <p>You are beginning a unit called &#8220;Telling Our Stories.&#8221; One of the great things about reading is that it can transport you to so many different places, some real and some imaginary. Stories can also teach you about different parts of the world, different cultures, and different communities. Over the next few weeks, you are going to be reading many different stories, thinking about what makes a good story, and exploring what you can learn about the communities in which they take place.</p>
