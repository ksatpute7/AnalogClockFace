They will be given sentences that they can complete, or they can write something else about their learning from the lesson. </p> <p>     Explain that reflections are different from the usual work students do in their Notebooks. In reflections students write about their understandings or confusions, questions they want to think about or ask later, and their feelings about mathematics. There are no right or wrong ideas in reflections; they are basically a journal of each studentâ€™s mathematical thinking. </p> <figure id="ch05unfig06" class="informalfigure marginalia"> <img alt="" src="03-math-math-03-9780328760886-math-9780328760886-aa-studio-articles-images-p14-1.jpg" height="187" width="248"> </figure> <p>     Have each student write a brief reflection before the end of class. Alternatively, students can make a voice recording of their reflection using the record button on the tablet. Review the reflections to find out what students know about expanded form. </p> <p>     When students have completed their writing or recording, demonstrate how they will share their work with you. Tell students what they should do with the technology at the end of the lesson and how they should begin the lesson tomorrow. </p> </section> </section>   </body></html>
