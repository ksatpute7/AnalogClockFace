They should turn to their partner, share their ideas, and listen to their partnerâ€™s ideas. When they hear the signal that time is up, they should turn their bodies back toward you, showing that they are ready to continue. Turn and Talks keep students engaged, help them to synthesize their thoughts, and allow you to check for comprehension.</p></div><div class="amplifications"><div class="amp swd" data-amplification-type="swd"><div class="col"><div class="amp-content"><p>Guide students in selecting goals that are appropriate to their needs. For example, they may wish to read faster but need to monitor for meaning as they read because they struggle with comprehension, so this should be the goal selected.</p></div></div></div></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Ask students to read the Possible Reading Goals list and choose three of the goals from the list (they may include the goals they set at the end of last year).
