Encourage other students to be patient if the pace of ELLs is slower than native speakers, and explain that listening attentively is one way in which we show we care for others. </p> </section> </section> <section id="ch05lev3sec52"><header> <h1 class="title">Mathematical Practices</h1> </header> <p> <strong>Mathematical Practice 1: Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them.</strong> </p> <ul> <li> <p>                Students discuss how they made sense of the problem by sharing their “ask myself” questions and describing any strategies they used to persevere if they got stuck. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <strong>Mathematical Practice 7: Look for and make use of structure.</strong> </p> <ul> <li> <p>                Identifying the patterns in the chart helps students understand written numbers in our place value system. </p> </li> </ul> </section> </section><br> <br>   </body></html>
