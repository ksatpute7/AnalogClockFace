Over the course of the week, students focus on the  rituals and routines of the program. They learn about the routines in  each lesson: Opening, Work Time, Ways of Thinking, Apply the Learning (some lessons), Summary of the Math, Reflection, and Exercises. Students discuss classroom norms and expectations  and how to take responsibility for their own learning. They learn how to  present their work to the class, how to work with a partner, how to be a  productive listener during presentations, the types of questions to ask presenters, and how to work on their own by using “ask  myself” questions and resources if they get stuck. </p> <p>                                                                                In the  last lesson, students talk about the importance of taking responsibility  for their own learning. Students learn about the Gallery and how to  choose a Gallery problem. They will choose one of three Gallery problems  that introduce the unit’s technology resources and deal with the  place-value concepts students learned in the unit. </p> <p>                                                                                The  mathematical work of the unit focuses on place value. Students work with  the expanded form of three-digit numbers and solve place-value riddles.  They explore patterns in the hundred chart and use the patterns to find  missing numbers and skip-count by 5s or 10s. </p> </section> <section class="introduction level2" id="pt10intro02"><hgroup> <h1 class="title">Contents</h1> </hgroup></section> <ul class="nomark"> <li class="toclevel1"><a href="TG-Math-3-10-0-1.xhtml#ch58lev1sec01"><span class="title"><span class="label">Lesson </span><span class="number">1: </span>Numbers in Expanded Form</span> <span class="pageref">7</span></a> <p>                                                                                                          Students will determine the partner they will work with for the week by  matching cards that show either a numeral or expanded form.
