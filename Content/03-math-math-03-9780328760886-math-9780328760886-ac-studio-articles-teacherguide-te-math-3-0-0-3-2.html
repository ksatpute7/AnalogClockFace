<p>
	                  Explain to students that in most lessons they will work on problems on their own before talking about their ideas with a partner. Working individually first gives students a chance to think about the problem on their own before listening to other student’s ideas. Point out that students will be better able to determine what they understand and what is confusing if they have time to think about a problem alone.

	                  Ask a few students to read aloud the instructions on the Work Alone poster (see <a href="TE-Math-3-0-0-3.xhtml#ch05lev1sec3" class="xref"><span class="label">Lesson </span><span class="number">3</span></a> Preparation). Address any questions students have about what it means to be working alone in math class.

 <section><span class="leadin leadin_lc_1">ELL:</span>
<p>
	                 Reading the problem in its entirety with careful enunciation and highlighting essential terms and phrases is helpful for ELLs. If necessary, reread the problem one sentence at a time.

<h1 class="title">Teacher Demonstration</h1>
 </header>
<p>
	                  Read the Opening problem.
</p>
<p>
	                  Explain that it is important for students to first make sense of a problem before beginning to solve it. Tell students that sometimes when they start working on their own, they many not be sure what to do or how to get started. Explain that a good way to approach a problem is to use “ask myself” questions to make sense of the problem before you try to solve it.
</p>
<p>
	                  Demonstrate how to use “ask myself” questions to understand the Opening problem, such as the following.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
		                  Are there any words or phrases that I don’t understand? For example, what does “a numbers chart that goes past 100” mean?
	</p>
	<p>
		                  Well, I remember looking at the hundred chart before—that is a chart with numbers.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		                  Can I explain the problem in my own words?
	</p>
	<p>
		                  Let me read the problem—I know that is often helpful. Hmmm...it seems to want me to write the rest of the numbers in the chart.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		                  What does the picture show?
	</p>
	<p>
		                  When I look at the picture it shows a hundred chart with three additional rows after 100.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		                  What are the numbers in the problem and what do they mean?
	</p>
	<p>
		                  I see that Abdul has written 101, 102, 103, 103, 104, and 105. Those are counting by 1s starting with 101.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		                  Is this problem like anything I have done before?
	</p>
	<p>
		                  Well, we were just looking at the patterns in the hundred chart. I remember in second grade filling in missing numbers of a hundred chart. Both of those will help me.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		                  What is the problem asking for?
	</p>
	<p>
		                  (Oh I see—it is here: “Write the next three rows of numbers.") I need to continue the pattern.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		                  Can I use counters or a sketch to help me find the answers?
	</p>
	<p>
		                  I could draw a square for the 100 and then 5 small circles to represent the number 105 that Abdul wrote. Then I could draw one circle more as I count by 1s in the number chart. I can even draw a rectangle around the 10 small circles when I get there to show each ten.
	</p>
	 </li>
</ul>
<p>
	                  After the demonstration, ask students:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
		                  What questions can you ask yourself to make sense of a problem?
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		                  What else can you do if you get stuck on a problem?
	</p>
	 </li>
</ul>
<p>
	                  Think: Have students spend a few minutes thinking about these two questions on their own.
</p>
<p>
	                  Turn and Talk: Then have students turn and talk to their partner about their ideas.
</p>
<p>
	                  Discuss: Ask students to share their ideas with the class. Record students’ ideas on one of two charts that you can post permanently in the classroom: "Ask Myself" Questions and What to Do When You Get Stuck.
</p>
<p>
	                  These Hints are given to students as ideas about “ask myself” questions:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
		                  What does________mean?
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		                  What is this problem talking about?
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		                  What kinds of comparisons is the problem looking at?
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		                  What are the numbers in the problem and what do they mean?
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		                  What is the problem asking for?
	</p>
	 </li>
</ul>
<p>
	                  These Hints are given to students as ideas about what to do if they get stuck on a problem:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
		                  Look at my previous work.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		                  Model the problem using counters or other materials.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		                  Sketch a diagram or other representation.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		                  Write what you do know.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		                  Write questions to ask later.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		                  Check other resources.
	</p>
	 </li>
</ul>
<p>
	                  After you list students’ ideas, review each one for clarity. Students do not need to agree on each item—having a diverse list is useful. Students can continue to develop the lists throughout the year. Take a photo of the "Ask Myself" Questions and What to Do When You Get Stuck lists to share with the students.

	 <strong>Mathematical Practice 1: Make sense of problems and persevere in solving them</strong>
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
		                  The use of “ask myself” questions gives students a way to make sense of a task. The list of things to do if you get stuck also helps students make sense of problems, and gives them the resources they need to persevere through difficulty.
