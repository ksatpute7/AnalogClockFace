Explain that genre means a type or kind of reading and/or writing. Explain that books fall into categories, just like movies. For example, movies like <em>Star Wars</em> and <em>Star Trek</em> fall into the category of movies about space. Books like <em>Captain Underpants</em> and <em>The Diary of a Wimpy Kid</em> are in a humorous, or funny, category.</p></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Show students examples of the following genres: realistic fiction, fantasy fiction, informational text, poetry, drama, fairytale, and memoir.</p></div><div class="amplifications"><div class="amp ell" data-amplification-type="ell"><div class="col"><h3 data-proficiency-type="Emerging" class="proficiency-heading">Emerging <em class="standard-id" data-display="hidden" data-standard-id="P1.3.3">P1.3.3</em></h3><div class="amp-content"><p>As you show the genre examples, simply ask Emerging ELLs whether a book is fiction or nonfiction.

Encourage students to paraphrase what you said about the genres in their own words. Then have students compare the genres and offer their opinions using an expanded and detailed sentence frame to elaborate on an idea:</p><ul><li>As I compare the genres _____ and _____, I find that it is important to read a variety of them because _____.</li></ul></div></div></div></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Use the following definitions to help students understand different genres:</p><ul><li><strong>Realistic fiction</strong>—stories about characters and events that did not really happen but could happen.</li><li><strong>Fantasy fiction</strong>—stories that take place in make-believe and imaginative worlds about characters that may not exist doing things that could not happen.</li><li><strong>Fairytale</strong>—stories about characters and events that involve magical beings such as fairies, and usually begin “Once upon a time” and end “and they lived happily ever after.”</li><li><strong>Informational text</strong>—texts that provide real information about people, places, events, or things; or that tell the reader how to do something.</li><li><strong>Poetry</strong>—writing that expresses ideas, feelings, or events, often written with rhythm and rhyme (like words to a song), using craft such as metaphor, simile, and onomatopoeia.</li><li><strong>Drama</strong>—writing that tells a story and is meant to be performed on stage.</li><li><strong>Autobiography/memoir</strong>—writing in which an author retells an event or events from his or her own life, often including a personal reflection on those events.</li></ul></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Tell students that words like genre, which are usually used in a school setting, are a type of academic language. Point out that they have already learned words that are academic language: <em>discussion</em> and <em>autobiography</em>. Tell them that they will be learning more of these type of words throughout the year.</p></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Ask students to discuss why it is important to read a variety of genres.
