Tell students to find a classmate whose card has a number equal to the number on their own card. Explain that classmates with matching cards will be partners for the week. </p> <p>                 Once students find their partner, distribute a tablet to each student. Give the students their login information.

For example, show students that clapping your hands is a signal for them to stop their work and to focus attention on you. </p> <p>                 Then refer students to the Opening picture of the card for the number 872. Ask students a question. </p> <ul> <li> <p>                 How did you know that the number on your card is equal to the number on your partner’s card? </p> </li> </ul> <p>                 Students might say that the number of hundreds, tens, and ones in both numbers is the same. Use this discussion to assess students’ ability to explain their reasoning. Do not spend time correcting reasoning errors at this point. Instead, focus on asking probing questions and soliciting various approaches so students can see that there are many different ways to think about what might seem like a simple matching task. </p> <section id="ch44lev3sec4"> <hgroup> <h1>Expanded Form Icebreaker Activity Cards</h1> <figure id="ch05unfig01"> <img alt="" src="03-math-math-03-9780328760886-math-9780328760886-aa-studio-articles-images-mth-3-0-1-1_tch_form.jpg" width="271"> </figure></hgroup> </section> </section> </section>   </body></html>
