Tell students that things we can name are called nouns. Nouns are people, places, animals, things, or ideas.</p></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Read aloud the following words: <em>door</em>, <em>inside</em>, <em>cat</em>, <em>beautiful</em>, <em>oven</em>, <em>green</em>, <em>schoolyard</em>, <em>courage</em>. Have students give a thumbs-up if the word is a noun and a thumbs-down if it isn’t. If necessary, remind students that courage is a noun because qualities and ideas are also nouns.</p></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Remind students that nouns act as the subject of a sentence or as the object of a sentence. Display the following sentence: The girls played basketball. Point out that the subject of the sentence, which is in front of the verb, is girls. The word <em>girls</em> is a noun. Point out that the object of the sentence, or what the action is about, is <em>basketball</em>. Basketball is also a noun.</p></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Have students use the annotation tools and the erase feature.
