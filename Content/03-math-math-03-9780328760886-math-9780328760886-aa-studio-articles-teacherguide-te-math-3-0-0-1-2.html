Explain that sentence frames help students think about how to talk about the mathematics in a lesson. Write these three sentence frames on the board. </p> <ul> <li> <p>                          I do my best work when______. </p> </li> <li> <p>                          I work well with my classmates if______and______. </p> </li> <li> <p>                          Rules that will help everyone in class learn are______,______, and______. </p> </li> </ul> <p>                          Demonstrate for students how to use the first sentence frame. </p> <ul> <li> <p> <span class=" emphasis" ""="" "="">I do my best work when</span> I can use a diagram or a model to help me understand what I am doing. I don’t understand things well if I just hear them. I need to see them to understand. So today, when I am trying to find answers to the problems, I will draw pictures to help me if I don’t understand. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <span class="strong">Turn and talk:</span> Then have students turn and talk to a partner about how to complete the sentences. Explain that talking with a partner is an important part of the math class. Partners should express their ideas in their own words and listen carefully to each other. </p> <p> <span class="strong">Discuss:</span> After a few minutes have students share their ideas with the class. Record students’ ideas for classroom norms on the board. </p> <p>                          These hints are given to students as ideas for classroom norms. </p> <ul> <li> <p>                          Ask questions and think creatively. </p> </li> <li> <p>                          Talk about your ideas and questions with your classmates. </p> </li> <li> <p>                          Use mathematics vocabulary when you talk or write about math. </p> </li> <li> <p>                          Make connections between what you know and what you are learning. </p> </li> <li> <p>                          If you do not know how to solve a problem, write what you <span class="emphasis">do</span> know. </p> </li> <li> <p>                          Think about what you are learning from a task, instead of just trying to finish it quickly. </p> </li> <li> <p>                          Think of a mistake as a chance to learn, not as something to hide. </p> </li> <li> <p>                          Check your work and think about what caused you to make a mistake. Learn how to correct your work. </p> </li> <li> <p>                          Be respectful and helpful when you work together with your classmates so that everyone learns. </p> </li> </ul> <p>                          Tell students about the “6-inch voices and sound levels” rule. This rule means that the volume of students’ voices and of the technology should travel no more than 6 inches. Have students practice the guideline a few times; ask students how well it is working. This guideline is helpful in keeping the classroom noise level at an acceptable volume during partner work and when students watch videos or animations. </p> <p>                          After students have shared all their ideas about classroom norms, review each idea for clarity and class agreement. Then record the final list on chart paper in a permanent location of the classroom. Take a photo and share them with the students. You do not need to explain sharing at this time. You will introduce some features on the tablet during the beginning of Work Time. </p> <section> <span class="leadin leadin_lc_1">ELL:</span> <p>                           Sentence frames support ELLs by providing a structure for developing  English language skills and giving meaning to mathematical terms.  Sentence strips can be used to support ELLs at various language levels: </p> <ul> <li>             Basic: This is a <u>square</u>. </li> <li>             Developing: This is a <u>square</u> because it has four sides that are the same. </li> <li>             Bridging: This is a <u>four-sided polygon</u> with all <u>sides equal</u> and <u>four right angles</u>; therefore, it is a <u>square</u>. </li> </ul> <p>        Talking with a partner allows ELLs to verbalize their thinking, seek clarification from their peers, and practice their listening and speaking skills. </p> </section> <br> </section> </section><br>   <br><br></body></html>
