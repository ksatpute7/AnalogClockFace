<h1 class="title">Lesson Flow</h1>
 </header>
<p>
	                                       In Lesson 1 students are introduced to measuring and comparing  liquid volumes using nonstandard units. The lesson establishes the need  for using standard units in order to make volume comparisons meaningful.  Lesson 2 provides students with experience measuring volume in  milliliters and liters using a liter cube. In Lesson 3 students use  addition and subtraction to solve word problems involving measuring  volume.
</p>
<p>
	                                       The next four lessons focus on weight measurement. In  Lesson 4 students investigate and compare the weights of common objects.  In this lesson they first compare weights by “feel.” Then they use a  homemade balance to compare the weights of objects. Students measure  using nonstandard units (i.e., dimes and nickels) in Lesson 5 and learn  the importance of using standardized measurement units. They then weigh  objects in grams and kilograms using a pan balance. In Lessons 6 and 7  students use addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to  solve word problems involving measuring weight in grams and kilograms.  In Lesson 7 they also complete two Self Check tasks involving volume and  weight.
</p>
<p>
	                                       Lesson 8 is a Putting It Together lesson. Students  consolidate what they have learned as they measure both weight and  volume, and solve problems based on their measurements. The unit ends  with a Gallery lesson in which students choose a task that reviews  and/or extends the skills they learned in the unit.
