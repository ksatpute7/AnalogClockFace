                        <p>It&#8217;s now time for you to decide on the text structures you will use in your poster project. Which text structures will give the reader the clearest understanding of your topic?</p><p>You may choose to use more than one text structure, as the author did in <em>Turtles &amp; Tortoises</em>. Look at the informational texts you used to collect information on your animal&#8212;which text structures did these authors use? You may consider using similar text structures in your writing. </p><div class="panel"><ul><li>Begin to draft sections of your poster based on the information you have collected and organized. <strong></strong></li><li>After you have completed a draft of your poster, send a copy to your teacher for feedback.
