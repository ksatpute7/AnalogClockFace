Have them guess which jobs require a college degree and which require training. Promote each job as equivalent in its importance (e.g., a custodian is as important to the school community as the principal is). Remind students that one goal of school is to help them prepare for college and to be ready for a career—whatever field it is. Prompt them to think about a career that they might like to have someday. Point out that they can be whatever they want by studying and working hard—no matter what their family income is and so on. Emphasize that everyone has the chance to go to college!</p></div></div></div></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Talk about how the interview questions should include getting information on how the community member works with others in the school for the common good.</p></div><div class="amplifications"><div class="amp ell" data-amplification-type="ell"><div class="col"><h3 data-proficiency-type="Emerging" class="proficiency-heading">Emerging <em class="standard-id" data-display="hidden" data-standard-id="P1.3.1">P1.3.1</em></h3><div class="amp-content"><p>Emerging ELLs can benefit from interviewing adults in familiar roles.
