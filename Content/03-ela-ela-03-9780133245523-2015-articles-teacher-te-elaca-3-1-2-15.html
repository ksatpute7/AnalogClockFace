They will learn about Writing Conferences and work on writing their reports.</div><div class="materials"><h2>Materials</h2><ul><li>Chart paper and markers</li><li>Materials to provide sentence frames (for ELLs)</li></ul></div><div class="preparation"><h2>Lesson Preparation</h2><div class="content"><ul><li>Read the lesson and student content.</li><li>Anticipate student difficulties and identify the differentiation options you will choose for working with your students.</li><li>It is important to establish the ritual of conferring about student writing by explaining to students how teacher-initiated Writing Conferences work. They are very similar to Reading Conferences in that they are one-to-one meetings with you and that during the conference, you can individualize instruction and support.</li><li>Prepare a Writing Conference schedule, but do not ignore a student who needs you on a particular day.</li><li>Create an anecdotal form (either on paper or on a Notebook page) for taking notes during Writing Conferences so that you and your students understand individual expectations and instruction. The anecdotal notes will allow you to monitor instruction and student work as well as to plan instruction for future lessons and conferences. It is the chance for you to know students as individual writers, to know their strengths and weaknesses, and to plan for next steps.</li><li>In most cases, the following structure works well for a conference:
<ul><li>Celebrate: Say something the writer did well.</li><li>Confirm: Say what you think the piece is about to check for the authorâ€™s purpose.</li><li>Continue: Say something to help the writer (focus on one thing).</li></ul></li><li>Prepare sentence frames for ELLs to use in Task 2.</li></ul></div></div></div></section></div></div><script src="scripts/jquery.js">//</script>
