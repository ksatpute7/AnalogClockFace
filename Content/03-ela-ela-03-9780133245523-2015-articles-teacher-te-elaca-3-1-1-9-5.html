Explain that as you confer with them, you will ask them about what they are reading, what they understand about what they are reading, what they are having difficulty with, or what successes they have achieved. You may also ask them to read aloud or discuss the book they are currently reading.</p></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Tell students that during the conference you will review the reading goals they set for themselves, check their Reading Logs, give them feedback on their reading, and answer any questions they may have. You may also help readers choose a just-right text—one that is not too hard or too easy for them to read on their own (Independent Reading level).</p></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Tell the class which students you will be conferring with today. Explain that they will all get a turn in the coming days.</p></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>The first conference with each student will be more of a “getting to know you” conference. Plan to meet with four students during the class work period. You will be meeting with two to three students each day during Independent Reading time.</p></div></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></section></div></div><script src="scripts/jquery.js">//</script>
