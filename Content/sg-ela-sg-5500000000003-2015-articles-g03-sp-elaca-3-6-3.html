Remind students that if a word has two syllables, it must have two vowel sounds. Then, have them divide these words into syllables.<br></br>
Example: suggest sug – gest</li><li>Find plural words that end in <strong>-s</strong>, <strong>-es</strong>, and <strong>-ies</strong>. Then, have students find the root word of each plural word.<br></br>
Example: wishes/wish</li><li>Find words that end in <strong>-ed</strong>, <strong>-ing</strong>, <strong>-er</strong>, and <strong>-est</strong>. Then, have students find the root word of each of these words.<br></br>
Example: dropped/drop</li><li>Find words that are digraphs; they have two vowels that combine to form a long vowel sound. “When two vowels go walking, the first one does the talking.”<br></br>
Examples: boat, seed, clean</li><li>Find words that are diphthongs: they have two vowels that glide into one sound.<br></br>
Example: about, brown</li></ul></div></li></ul></div></section></div></div><script src="scripts/jquery.js">//</script>
