Be sure to explain that a score point 1 isn’t necessarily “bad,” but rather something to work on. You will want to revisit this rubric as necessary, either with the whole class or during student conferences until the behaviors are internalized.</p></div><div class="amplifications"><div class="amp swd" data-amplification-type="swd"><div class="col"><div class="amp-content"><p>Use an alternative rubric for assessing students with disabilities. Students should know before beginning an assignment what the expectations for performance will be. The expectations should be reviewed with the student so the student is able to monitor his or her progress as the unit progresses.</p></div></div></div><div class="amp ell" data-amplification-type="ell"><div class="col"><h3 data-proficiency-type="Emerging" class="proficiency-heading">Emerging <em class="standard-id" data-display="hidden" data-standard-id="P1.3.1">P1.3.1</em></h3><div class="amp-content"><p>Meet briefly with Emerging ELLs to model how to use the completed rubric to assess his or her own behavior with visuals. For example, to respond to “Did you do well?” students will have a smiley face and a sad face. Students can also contribute to conversations and express ideas by asking and answering <em>yes-no</em> and <em>wh-</em> questions using short phrases such as:</p><ul><li>Did you enjoy it?</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="amp ell" data-amplification-type="ell"><div class="col"><h3 data-proficiency-type="Expanding" class="proficiency-heading">Expanding <em class="standard-id" data-display="hidden" data-standard-id="P1.3.1">P1.3.1</em></h3><div class="amp-content"><p>Meet briefly with Expanding ELLs to model how to use the completed rubric to assess their own behavior with words. Students will Turn and Talk to a partner of their choice to discuss their ratings orally. Offer a sentence frame:</p><ul><li>I am a score point _____. I gave myself this score because _____. This means I need to focus on _____ when I read. However, I do well on _____.</li></ul><p>Encourage these partners as they work:</p><ul><li>That’s great!</li><li>I like how you … .</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="amp ell" data-amplification-type="ell"><div class="col"><h3 data-proficiency-type="Bridging" class="proficiency-heading">Bridging <em class="standard-id" data-display="hidden" data-standard-id="P1.3.1">P1.3.1</em></h3><div class="amp-content"><p>Ask Bridging ELLs if they need any clarification on the rubric. As they use the completed rubric to assess their own behavior with words, have them Turn and Talk to a student who has a higher level of English proficiency to discuss their ratings orally.
