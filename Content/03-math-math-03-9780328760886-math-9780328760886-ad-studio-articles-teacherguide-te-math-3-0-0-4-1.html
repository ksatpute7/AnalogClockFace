Explain that students can use these Ways of Thinking Hints to ask meaningful questions; they can also think of their own questions to ask. Ask students the following question. </p> <ul> <li> <p>         What are some of the general types of questions that you can ask presenters? </p> </li> </ul> <p> <span class="strong">Think:</span> Have students think about this question for a moment. </p> <p> <span class="strong">Turn and Talk:</span> Ask students to discuss their ideas with their partner. </p> <p> <span class="strong">Discuss:</span> Ask students share their ideas with the class. Record students’ questions on a chart that you will keep posted throughout the year. Review each question for clarity. Take a photo and share it with the students. </p> <p>         These Hints are given to students as ideas about questions that they can ask presenters. </p> <ul> <li> <p>         “I do not understand.
