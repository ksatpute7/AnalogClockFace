Ask students how the patterns they notice are similar and different for the following examples. </p> <ul> <li> <p>         Skip-counting by 5s and 10s </p> </li> <li> <p>         Using a start number of 605 and 610 </p> </li> <li> <p>         Using number chart 201 to 250 and 601 to 700 </p> </li> </ul> <p>         Draw out the following ideas. </p> <ul> <li> <p>         You always shade the same number in the 5 column or the 10 column. You never shade in other columns. This is because you start with a number with 5 or 0 in the ones place and are skip-counting by 5s or 10s. </p> </li> <li> <p>         Skip-counting by 10s is like adding 10 each time. As you move down a column on the chart, each number is always 10 more; so, when you skip-count by 10s, you always go down a column. </p> </li> </ul> <p>         Ask students to compare the different explanations of the patterns. Ask students the following question. </p> <ul> <li> <p>         Which pattern description is most convincing? Why? </p> </li> </ul> <p>         As you facilitate the discussion, keep track of the types of questions students ask presenters. At the end of the discussion, thank the students who asked presenters questions that are listed as hints as well as the students who formulated their own questions. </p> <p>         Ask students about the list of ways to contribute as listeners. Do they have any more ideas to add? Write them on the chart and to the list you shared with the students.</p> <p>         Ask a few students who completed the Challenge Problem to present their way of thinking about skip-count backward. </p> </section> <section><span class="leadin leadin_lc_2">SWD:</span> <p>         Ask students what questions arose during the lesson.
