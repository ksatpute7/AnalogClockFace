There are two types of division situations: </p> <ul> <li> <p> <span class="emphasis">Partitive</span>, or sharing division, is division to find the number of objects in each group. In sharing situations, the number of groups is known and division is used to find the size of each group. </p> </li> <li> <p> <span class="emphasis">Quotitive</span>, or grouping division, is division to find the number of groups.

Students use an interactive to explore the factors of a number and the relationship between multiplication and division. Students move on in later lessons to focus first on partitive division, then quotitive division. Students are also introduced to division word problems, writing math stories, and using arrays and tape diagrams to represent division. </p> <p>                                                                     In this unit, you use only horizontal notation (e.g., <span class="inlineequation"></span><math> <mrow> <mn>12</mn><mo>÷</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>4 </mn></mrow></math>). Vertical notation is not an equation. It is a paper-and-pencil calculation method, well-suited to doing long division, but not necessary for developing conceptual understanding of the meaning of division. Therefore, we introduce vertical notation such as </p> <img class="" src="03-math-math-03-9780328760831-studio-articles-images-image5.jpg"> <p>                                           in fourth grade when long division is introduced. </p> </section><section> <hgroup> <h1 class="title">Contents</h1> </hgroup> <ol class="tocentrylist"> <li class="toclevel1"> <p> <span class="strong title"> Lesson 1: A New Operation</span> </p> <p>                                                           Students chant with the animation to review the twos through fives.

Interpret whole-number quotients of whole numbers, e.g.,  interpret <math> <mrow> <mn>56</mn><mo>÷</mo><mn>8</mn></mrow> </math> as the number of objects in each share when 56  objects are partitioned equally into 8 shares, or as a number of shares  when 56 objects are partitioned into equal shares of 8 objects each.

Some learners move through the sequence rather quickly, while others, particularly students with disabilities, require explicit modeling, abundant time and experiences, and repeated practice within each stage before they can construct understanding within the later stage. This sequence of learning leads to deep conceptual understanding rather than memorization of a rote set of procedures. </p> <p class="marginalia">                                                                     The concrete stage is the most basic level of understanding and the most vital in the learners' ability to construct meaning. At the concrete stage, learners work with discrete manipulatives, like counters, cubes, and objects that can be put into groups and counted. Students with disabilities require modeling, explicit instruction, guided practice, and then abundant independent experiences to fully understand the concept. Toward the end of plentiful work in the concrete stage, students will move toward the next stage in the framework, connecting the concrete to the representational. </p> <p class="marginalia">                                                                    The representational stage begins when students are able to solve problems by representing concrete objects in drawings. Encourage students not to draw the actual objects, but to use a representation that can stand in the place of the discrete objects. Tally marks, circles, and cubes are among the most used representations. Other tools like open number lines are often used during this stage, too. Once a student can solve a problem by using a drawing to represent the context of the problem, they are guided toward the abstract. </p> <p class="marginalia">                                                                     In the abstract stage, students use numbers and math symbols to solve problems. Being able to set up and solve problems such as equations requires a pencil and paper or mental computation. This stage is the most advanced and often requires prior concrete and representational understanding before it is mastered by students with disabilities. </p> <p class="marginalia">                                                                     If a student is struggling in math, knowing this framework and a student's position within the stages can help you prescribe instruction. If a student is not yet to the abstract stage, see if they can draw pictures to represent the context, if not move back to the concrete stage. Provide more work in the concrete stage while also linking the concrete to the representational. First have the student work out the problem with objects and then model drawing a representation of the context. Once students have had many opportunities to master the representational stage of learning, they can be guided to write the equation with their representation. Working toward abstract learning is the goal, but often takes longer for some students. </p> </section><section id="intro01div06"> <hgroup> <h1 class="marginalia">Artifacts of the Math Classroom</h1> </hgroup> <p class="marginalia">                                                                     Displaying math artifacts prominently in the classroom documents and makes the learning visible and greatly supports all learners.

Terms for this unit include equation, expression, array, row, column, area, factor, product, dividend, divisor, and quotient. In addition to using the terms in context, consider providing a visual glossary or prominently displayed word wall that illustrates each of the terms to be used as a visual reference for students.

For example, encourage students to say, “eight groups of six is forty-eight,” rather than “eight times six is forty-eight.” Providing the term that allows for visualization better assists students to create a mental picture of the context. </p> </section><section id="intro01div08"> <hgroup> <h1 class="marginalia">Anchor Charts</h1> </hgroup> <p class="marginalia">                                                                     Anchor charts are visual references used to capture math learning and strategies, which can be prominently displayed in the classroom and referenced by students in subsequent lessons. Anchor charts can be created during the Ways of Thinking discussion and should capture the essence of the students' learning. Many times the charts are created from least efficient to most efficient strategies and placed next to one another intentionally so connections and relationships can be discussed.

Prompting active engagement, this much-needed opportunity encourages every student to engage in answering the teacher's question, allows for articulation practice, and builds a sense in students of being an active and contributing member of their math learning community. Turn and Talk also provides the teacher with the chance to listen in on several pair responses rather than just hearing one student's response, which is typical during a whole group session. Consider setting up Turn and Talk rituals and routines early in the year and using the engagement strategy to keep all students actively engaged during mathematics. </p> </section><section id="intro01div14"> <hgroup> <h1 class="marginalia">White Response Boards</h1> </hgroup> <p class="marginalia">                                                                     The positive effects of using white response boards in the classroom include increased participation, greater accuracy in students' answers, immediate teacher feedback, and decreased lack of attention and misbehavior. The teacher poses a question and gives adequate wait time. Each student uses a dry erase marker to respond on their board, and then when requested by the teacher, students hold their boards up en masse. The teacher easily scans the responses to formatively assess students' understanding. In some instances, the teacher then presents the answer. In other circumstances, the teacher easily collects a few boards to share varied student responses, particularly if the problem prompted multiple solution strategies. This beneficial interactive response strategy often allows time for the teacher to confer with a struggling mathematician and help them solve while the other students are working. For best results, rituals and routines must be established. </p> </section><section id="intro01div15"> <hgroup> <h1 class="marginalia">Clarifying Assigned Tasks</h1> </hgroup> <p class="marginalia">                                                                     As you give directions for work that is to be completed during Work Time, ask students with disabilities to rephrase the instructions or ask them if they have clarifying questions.

Outlining the lesson for students gives them a visual reference to guide them in Work Time. </p> </section><section id="intro01div17"> <hgroup> <h1 class="marginalia">Must-Do Problem</h1> </hgroup> <p class="marginalia">                                                                     Struggling mathematicians often don't complete as many problems during Work Time as students that are more fluent and have a better conceptual understanding. Completing all the problems is not necessary and can contribute to holding back a class that is ready, as a whole, to move forward. To meet all learners' needs, consider offering a Must-Do Problem. The Must-Do Problem will be the first problem that is discussed during Ways of Thinking. Therefore, all students have completed and can be ready to discuss and learn from this preselected, purposely chosen problem. </p> </section><section id="intro01div18" class="level2 WorkTime marginalia"> <hgroup> <h1 class="marginalia">Student Grouping</h1> </hgroup> <p class="marginalia">                                                                     Daily, the teacher is gathering formative data to prescribe whole group, small group, and individualized instruction to meet students' needs. The Workshop format of Opening, Work Time, and Ways of Thinking with Reflection offers the necessary structure for a variety of ways to meet learners' needs. Placing students into a variety of groupings during Work Time is a valuable teaching tool that maximizes learning for all students. Within the structure of a unit, students have the opportunity to work collegially in pairs, within collaborative groups, in a teacher-led small group, or independently. The varied groupings are assigned purposefully and prescriptively based on the assigned task and to meet the needs of learners. The teacher is actively involved with the learning process and facilitates instruction to accelerate learning. Whether working in pairs, collaboratively, or independently, the students can expect that the teacher will drop in on conversation and confer with the students. </p> </section><section class="marginalia" id="intro01div19"> <hgroup> <h1 class="marginalia">Collegial Partner Work</h1> </hgroup> <p>                                                                     Intentional partnering based on the teacher's knowledge of the students' strength and weaknesses is an essential element in strategically selecting partner pairs. A partnership can lead to active and engaged learning, articulation about math reasoning, and growth of students' confidence as a mathematician. However, poor partner pairing can deter learning too. When thoughtfully and intentionally pairing students, particularly those with disabilities, carefully consider choosing a partner that will assist in a student's learning through mutual and respectful dialogue as they work toward joint solutions. The social interaction garnered from the collegial partnerships is advantageous to all students and can lead to the next horizon of learning. </p> </section><section id="intro01div20"> <hgroup> <h1 class="marginalia">Collaborative Groups</h1> </hgroup> <p class="marginalia">                                                                     To reinforce learning, collaborative groupings are also advantageous. When students work in groups of three or four, they must form and share their opinions, articulate their math reasoning, and justify their solutions. Working collaboratively also promotes viewing and analyzing other students' work, and using math talk to make connections between strategies. Like creating intentional partnerships, considerable thought should be given to students in each collaborative grouping. With intent and explicit instruction, students are taught about the rituals and routines associated with working in the collaborative group and the expectation is set that each member will be an active, respected, and contributing member. When the benefits are met, math learning is deepened. </p> </section><section id="intro01div21"> <hgroup> <h1 class="marginalia">Small Group Work</h1> </hgroup> <p class="marginalia">                                                                     Small group instruction creates the scaffolding to move a learner's mathematical thinking to the next level. All students should have some opportunity to participate in small group settings; however struggling mathematicians, particularly those with disabilities, will need more small group support than others to attain mastery of grade level standards. </p> <p class="marginalia">                                                                     Small group work, within Work Time, should be planned and deliberate to support learners' needs. This can be achieved almost daily. The teacher, under most circumstances, works with the small group to guide their learning on the daily Work Time assignment. If needed, the content may remain the same, but numbers can be altered to make the problems more familiar and easier to solve. </p> <p class="marginalia">                                                                     Having a purposeful system in place for creating small groups of students is vital for smooth transition from Opening to Work Time. Consider a board configuration that highlights students' names for small group instruction so they can transition quickly to the work area. The ritual and routine should be in place so that students immediately begin the task as soon as they get to the small group area. Avoid having students depend on the teacher to get them started. </p> <p class="marginalia">                                                                     By design, the teacher begins Work Time by quickly circulating around the room, and checking in on partners, collaborative groups, and/or independent workers. This assures a check that students have effectively started the assigned task and the learners will have the opportunity to ask clarifying questions. These few minutes will set the stage for uninterrupted time with the small group. </p> <p class="marginalia">                                                                     After completing this check, the teacher will return to the small group. The teacher, based on the students' work deliberatively decides whether students work independently under her direct supervision, or whether it is more beneficial for the small group to continue toward a solution together. This decision varies according to the task. </p> <p class="marginalia">                                                                     Easily accessible from the small group area are concrete models and math tools, including but not limited to small cubes, counters, hundreds charts, number lines, grid paper, and a white board. Often, the teacher reads the problem and provides the concrete model for students to manipulate. Through guidance and probing questions the students work toward a solution and record their answer. In recording, the teacher will assist in moving the students' thinking forward by asking them to record in the most efficient way based on their level of conceptual understanding. The progression moves from concrete, to representational, to abstract. </p> <p class="marginalia">                                                                     The teacher stays with the small group for a portion of the Work Time, perhaps 10 or 15 minutes, and then leaves the small group to support other students' learning. The teacher uses the remainder of time to collect student work, confer with students, and formulate a purposeful and focused Ways of Thinking session. </p> <p class="marginalia">                                                                     Another time that it may be appropriate to pull a small group is during the Summary of the Math or the Reflection routines. Students with disabilities may have difficulty articulating their learning through written response. Guide a small group toward formulating their summary of learning together and prescribe a shared reflection. The shared reflection can be written by the student in their math journal or can be typed and printed on a label to be placed or glued in their journal. </p> </section><section id="intro01div22"> <hgroup> <h1 class="marginalia">Independent Work</h1> </hgroup> <p class="marginalia">                                                                     There are days when students work independently. It's important to explicitly teach students about your expectations during independent work. Advise them on when they must solely work alone, and when it's acceptable to hold accountable math talk, ask a peer a question, or inquire for clarification. Though students are working independently under certain preset circumstances, there may still be a math hum in the room. Learning during this time may be optimized when students are taught acceptable conversation and interaction techniques. </p> </section><section id="intro01div23"> <hgroup> <h1 class="marginalia">Conferring</h1> </hgroup> <p class="marginalia">                                                                     Within Work Time, teachers facilitate students' mathematical learning by asking questions, having students articulate their thinking, guiding students toward making connections, and helping to clear up misconceptions. For about half of the Work Time, when the teacher is not with the small group, the teacher is conferring with individuals or pairs of students. At this time, the teacher is also strategically selecting student work, ideas, and strategies that will be highlighted in Ways of Thinking. Struggling mathematicians benefit from analyzing their work and articulating their reasoning. Conferring will help guide them to construct meaning and make connections. </p> </section><section id="intro01div24" class="level2 WaysOfThinking"> <hgroup> <h1 class="marginalia">Selecting Student Work</h1> </hgroup> <p class="marginalia">                                                                     Student work should be strategically and purposefully selected by the teacher during Work Time. Consider sharing student strategies in an order that will build toward the most efficient strategy. For struggling mathematicians, sharing a concrete model can not only be important, but also linking that concrete model to a visual and then representational model can move them toward their next math horizon. Ultimately, you want the student to be able to master the abstract, so the conversation that occurs about the relationship between strategies during this Ways of Thinking time is imperative for students with disabilities. When possible, using student work of the struggling learner when it aligns with the teaching point can be a powerful motivator and can build a student's self-confidence as a mathematician. </p> </section><section id="intro01div25" class="level2 Reflection"> <hgroup> <h1 class="marginalia">Varied Approaches</h1> </hgroup> <p class="marginalia">                                                                     The goal is for each student to be able to independently reflect and craft a written response for the day's learning.
