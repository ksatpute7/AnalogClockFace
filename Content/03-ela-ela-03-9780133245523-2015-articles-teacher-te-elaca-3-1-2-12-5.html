If needed, ask students questions to help them correct any misconceptions. You might ask:</p><ul><li>How does the text define community?</li><li>Is our school a place where people share goods, services, and buildings?</li><li>Does our school have customs and ideas that we share?</li><li>Do people in our school have different jobs?</li><li>Does anything in the text about kinds of community help us decide if the school is a community?</li></ul></div><div class="amplifications"><div class="amp swd" data-amplification-type="swd"><div class="col"><div class="amp-content"><p>Validate students’ ideas while listening in as they share with a partner. This will encourage them to share in the Whole Group Discussion. Let them know what they could share and that you will call on them. It may be helpful to have students write down what they plan to share in the discussion. This way they need not rely on memory when participating in the class discussion.</p></div></div></div><div class="amp ell" data-amplification-type="ell"><div class="col"><h3 data-proficiency-type="Emerging" class="proficiency-heading">Emerging <em class="standard-id" data-display="hidden" data-standard-id="P1.3.3">P1.3.3</em></h3><div class="amp-content"><p>Prior to the Whole Group Discussion, activate Emerging ELLs’ prior knowledge by referring to the list on communities the class created in the previous lesson.
