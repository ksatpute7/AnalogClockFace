Use a sticky note to provide some type of feedback that could include the following.</p><div class="panel"><ul><li>A question about a section or topic. (For example, &#8220;The poster says that tigers are carnivores. If they eat plants, will they get sick?&#8221;)</li><li>Something you learned. (For example, &#8220;I never knew that tigers only live in Asia. I thought tigers also lived in Africa.&#8221;)</li><li>A feature you found helpful. (For example, &#8220;The map helped me better understand where you can find different types  of tigers.&#8221;)</li></ul></div><p>Leave the sticky note near the author&#8217;s desk.</p>
