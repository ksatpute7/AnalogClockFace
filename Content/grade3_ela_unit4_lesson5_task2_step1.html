                        <p>Listen and follow along as your teacher reads the closure of <em>Gram&#8217;s Angel Food Cake</em>.</p><p>Turn and Talk with your partner. How did you know it was the end?</p><p>The author uses specific phrases to show readers that she is looking back at this time from the future. This is called a <em>reflective</em>&nbsp;<em>ending</em>, and it is something you could try in your narrative.</p><p>Turn and Talk with your partner about how you might use a reflective ending strategy to end your own narrative.</p><p>Now, imagine that Abi Gotthelf did <em>not</em> write the last page to this narrative. Imagine it ended on the second-to-last page with: &#8220;Everyone loved the cake, and no one suspected a thing. Abi got the piece with the hole in it, but she didn&#8217;t care. &#8220;Look, Gram,&#8221; she joked, &#8220;I ate the &#8216;hole&#8217; piece!&#8221;</p><p>In this ending, the story is over when Gram and Abi deal with the hole in the cake.</p><p>This is another strong way to end a narrative: a solution to the narrative&#8217;s main problem. </p><p>Turn and Talk with your partner about how you might use this strategy to end your narrative.</p><div class="panel"><ul><li>Now, make a decision about which strategy you want to try writing: a reflective ending that looks back from a later time or an ending where the story&#8217;s main problem is solved. If you have time, you can experiment with both.</li></ul></div>
