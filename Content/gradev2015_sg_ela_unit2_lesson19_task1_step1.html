As your teacher reads the 15 spelling words aloud, write them down on the left side.</li><li>Next, look at the list that shows the correct spelling of all the words. Using this word list, work with a partner to review your test. Write the correct spelling for any words you misspelled next to that word on the right side of your paper. If the word is spelled correctly, leave the right side blank.</li><li>Now, look through your own recent writing and find words that you had trouble with and want to work on. Add these words to the blank lines on the right side of your page. Your list should contain 15 words when you are finished. </li><li>To prepare for the spelling test on Day 5, study the right side of your pretest, which now has the correctly spelled words that you missed on the pretest along with the new words you added. Take your pretest home with you to help you study. </li></ul>
