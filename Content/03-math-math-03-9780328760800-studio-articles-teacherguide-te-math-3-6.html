	Students should be able to:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
		                        Show fluency with all products from 1 × 2 to 9 × 9.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		                        Understand that when the multiplier increases (or decreases) by 1, the product increases (or decreases) by the multiplicand for single-digit factors.
	</p>
	 </li>

<h1 class="title">Lesson Flow</h1>
 </header>
<p>
	                        This final third grade multiplication unit begins with a card sort that is designed to give students a chance to recall and solidify their understanding of their prior learning of multiplication properties. Next, after some investigation, students write rules for multiplying 1 and 10. Then students focus on multipliers of 10, and from there they move to multiplying multiples of 10 by single-digit numbers. Students focus on seeing a multiple of 10, such as 30, as 3 tens, and 2 groups of 30 as 2 groups of 3 tens or as 6 tens. In the last conceptual lesson of the unit, students play a penny toss game to understand that the product of any number and 0 is 0.
</p>
<p>
	                        Students continue to practice multiplication chants at the beginning of every lesson (and as time allows, at other times of day). This practice should continue until all students know from memory all products of two single-digit numbers.

		<p>
			                        Students continue chanting multiplication facts to attain fluency. Then students do a card sort to match the properties of multiplication they learned in previous units with calculations and diagrams that make use of these properties. Finally, students use each of the properties they learned so far to solve a single-digit multiplication problem.

		</p>
		<p>
			                        Students continue chanting multiplication facts to attain fluency. Students consider what multiplying groups of ones means and they devise a rule for multiplying by 1. Then students consider what multiplying groups of tens means and they apply their understanding of place value to devising a rule for multiplying by 10.

			                        Students continue memorizing facts by repeating the multiplication chant. Students solve a math story involving multiplication by 10 and share strategies for multiplying by 10. Next, students hear three different strategies based in the properties. For each strategy, students decide whether it will work and they use it to calculate 10 × 9.

			                        Students continue memorizing facts by repeating a multiplication chant. Students solve a problem involving 3 groups of 50 and share strategies based on place value and properties for multiplying by 10. Next, students apply their learning by solving similar problems.

			                        Students continue memorizing facts by repeating the multiplication chant. Students play a penny toss game to investigate multiplying by 0.

			                        Students have an opportunity to think about the concepts they learned in this unit by looking at some equations and determining whether they are true or false. For each equation, students use diagrams, examples, or explanations to show why the equation is true or false. This Putting It Together lesson builds on the Self Check students did in the prior lesson.

<p>
	                        7. Fluently multiply and divide within 100, using strategies such as the relationship between multiplication and division (e.g., knowing that 8 × 5 = 40, one knows 40 × 5 = 8) or properties of operations. By the end of Grade 3, know from memory all products of two one-digit numbers.
</p>
<p>
	 <span class="strong">Solve problems involving the four operations, and identify and explain patterns in arithmetic.</span>
</p>
<p>
	                        9. Identify arithmetic patterns (including patterns in the addition table or multiplication table), and explain them using properties of operations. For example, observe that 4 times a number is always even, and explain why 4 times a number can be decomposed into two equal addends.
