The lesson helps students notice patterns that are based on the distributive and commutative properties. Students use these patterns throughout the unit as they build the sixes, sevens, eights, and nines. </p> <p>                                                  The unit is structured much like Unit 3.3, with two days devoted to studying each multiplicand. The first day of studying begins with building that multiplication table. Students use patterns to build up each set of facts and they describe the patterns that they used. The second day spent on each set of facts deepens students understanding of multiplication by involving them in investigating the properties of operations. On some days the focus is on using the distributive property and on other days students work with the commutative property. </p> <p>                                                  While the focus of the unit is on understanding multiplication conceptually, students are also expected to know from memory the products of all single digit numbers. Each day begins with students chanting one of the multiplication chants. Some students may need more repetition than can be accommodated in math class. Chanting on the way to recess or lunch or asking students to teach the chants to a family member can provide that additional practice. By the end of the unit, students should be fluent with all facts from 1 x 2 to 9 x 9. Knowledge of these facts and of the properties will be important prerequisites for Unit 3.6. </p> </section><section id="intro01div03" class="level2"> <header> <h1 class="title"><span class="label">Contents</span></h1> </header></section> <p class="tocproductbodymatter"> </p> <ol class="tocentrylist"> <li class="toclevel1"> <p> <a href="TE-Math-3-5-0-1.xhtml#ch04lev1sec1"><span class="title"><span class="label">Lesson</span> <span class="number">1:</span> Patterns in Multiplication </span><span class="pageref">8</span></a> </p> <p>                                                   Students review the products learned in Unit 3.3 by repeating a multiplication chant.
