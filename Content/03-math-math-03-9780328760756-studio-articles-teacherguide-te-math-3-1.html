In the Exploratory lesson, students use what they know about telling time to the nearest 5 minutes to read an analog clock for an exact time. Students then investigate what all the tick marks on an analog clock mean and learn to tell and write time in hours and minutes. </p> <p>                                                  The remainder of the unit develops students’ ability to solve problems involving elapsed time. In Lesson 2, students are introduced to a timeline and learn to find time intervals less than or equal to an hour when given a start time and an end time. In Lesson 3, students use the timeline to find time intervals less than and greater than an hour when given a start time and an end time. In Lesson 4, students use the timeline to find either the start time or the end time when given a time and the elapsed time. In Lesson 5, students add and subtract time intervals to solve problems. Lesson 6 is the Putting It Together lesson: Students perform a card sort in which they match cards about a math story involving elapsed time. Lesson 7 is the Gallery, in which a range of tasks like those in the unit are provided. The unit ends with a Unit Assessment. </p> </section><nav id="pt10toc01" class="toc"><section class="introduction level2" id="pt10intro02"><hgroup> <h1 class="title">Contents</h1> </hgroup></section> <div class="tocproductfrontmatter"> <ul class="nomark"> <li class="toclevel1"><a href="TG-Math-3-10-0-1.xhtml#ch58lev1sec01"><span class="title"><span class="label">Lesson </span><span class="number">1: What Time Is It?</span></span> <span class="pageref">7</span></a> <p>                                                                                          What do the big and small tick marks on an analog clock mean?
