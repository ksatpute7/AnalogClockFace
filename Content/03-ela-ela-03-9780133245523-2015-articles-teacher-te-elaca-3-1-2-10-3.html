Two of them, <em>urged</em> and <em>sparingly</em> are review, while <em>shrieked</em> and <em>speechless</em> are new. You can use the following examples:</p><ul><li>Katje’s mother urged her to open the first box. <em>Urged</em> means you strongly encourage someone to do something. Would you urge someone to go for a walk? Would you urge someone to break his toys? What is something the person who looks after you has to urge you to do?</li><li>The people of Olst ate sparingly during the winter. When you use something <em>sparingly</em>, you use as little as possible. If you are running out of paint, do you use it sparingly? If you eat all of the cookies in the bag, are you eating them sparingly? Which would you want a teacher to give you sparingly, homework or recess time?</li><li>Mrs. deLand shrieked when the second box arrived. When you <em>shriek</em>, you say something in a high, loud voice. Would you shriek if someone jumped out to scare you? Would you shriek if you saw a butterfly? Tell your partner something that might make you shriek.</li><li>The townspeople stood in speechless wonder when so many boxes arrived. When you are <em>speechless</em>, you are amazed; you can’t say a thing. If you saw a kitten in your window, would you be speechless? If you saw a tiger in your window, would you be speechless? Tell your partner something that would make you speechless.</li></ul></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Remind students to write the four words down in their Personal Notebook along with a brief definition of each word.</p></div><div class="amplifications"><div class="amp ell" data-amplification-type="ell"><div class="col"><h3 data-proficiency-type="Emerging" class="proficiency-heading">Emerging <em class="standard-id" data-display="hidden" data-standard-id="P1.3.8">P1.3.8</em></h3><div class="amp-content"><p>As the whole class discusses the vocabulary words, select students to act out the terms. Emerging ELLs can benefit from watching other students act out the words in order to understand how they produce different effects on the audience. In addition, as each word is discussed, allow students to use their Notebook to sketch a picture of its meaning and/or use short phrases to define the word.</p></div></div></div><div class="amp ell" data-amplification-type="ell"><div class="col"><h3 data-proficiency-type="Expanding" class="proficiency-heading">Expanding <em class="standard-id" data-display="hidden" data-standard-id="P1.3.8">P1.3.8</em></h3><div class="amp-content"><p>As the whole class discusses the vocabulary words, act out the words “plead” and “beg” (for an extra recess) followed by the word <em>urge</em>, so that students see and hear the degree of change physically. This helps Expanding ELLs understand how different word choices have an effect. Then, select some ELLs to act out the words as each is discussed. Encourage students to state an example of what each word means orally, before they record the words in their Personal Notebook.</p></div></div></div><div class="amp ell" data-amplification-type="ell"><div class="col"><h3 data-proficiency-type="Bridging" class="proficiency-heading">Bridging <em class="standard-id" data-display="hidden" data-standard-id="P1.3.8">P1.3.8</em></h3><div class="amp-content"><p>As the whole class discusses the vocabulary words, select students to act out the terms. In addition, have the student who will act out the word <em>shrieked</em> first act out the words “whisper” and “yell.” This helps Bridging ELLs see and hear the degree of change physically. Then, select some ELLs to act out the words as each is discussed. Encourage students to state an example of what each word means orally using complex sentences, before they record the words in their Personal Notebook.</p></div></div></div></div></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></section></div></div><script src="scripts/jquery.js">//</script>
