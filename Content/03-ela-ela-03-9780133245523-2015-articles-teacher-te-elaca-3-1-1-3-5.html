By checking their entries periodically, you can see at a glance what and how much each student is reading. You can spot potential problems such as frequent abandonment of books, reading books that are too hard or too easy, not reading enough, etc. The Reading Log also provides potential grading possibilities.</p></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Explain what a Reading Log is and why people keep them. If you are going to have students share their logs with each other, let them know that this is a way to find out about good books to read from people they know.</p></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Help students set up a Reading Log, whether on paper or electronically. They should log the following information about each book:</p><ul><li>Date</li><li>Book</li><li>Author</li><li>Pages Read</li><li>Comments, Questions, or Notes</li><li>1 to 5 Stars Rating (when finished with the book)</li></ul></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Make sure to clarify your expectations about student entries to their Reading Log. You may choose to have the Reading Log used solely for Independent Reading books, or you may wish to have students also record their assigned class reading to help them stay in the habit of keeping their log up-to-date.</p></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Have students add their homework reading choice to the log. Students can also log the text they read during Independent Reading in the prior lesson, if they like.</p></div><div class="amplifications"><div class="amp swd" data-amplification-type="swd"><div class="col"><div class="amp-content"><p>Check over studentsâ€™ Reading Logs to assess their progress; provide them with specific feedback about what they have accomplished and what needs to be completed for homework</p></div></div></div></div></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></section></div></div><script src="scripts/jquery.js">//</script>
