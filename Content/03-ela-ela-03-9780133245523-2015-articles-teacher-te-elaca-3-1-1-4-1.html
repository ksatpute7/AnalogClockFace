Accept responses that explain that a rubric is a list of agreed-upon criteria that can be used to judge the quality of a piece of work. Say to students:</p><ul><li>For example, if everyone agreed that a piece of writing must be easy to read and not sloppy, then the criteria for judging a piece of writing would be its neatness. A rubric is a tool for deciding what works well and what needs more work.</li></ul></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Suggest students add the word <em>rubric</em> to their Personal Notebook.</p></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Explain that the focus of this lesson is Independent Reading behaviors or habits. Review the Independent Reading chart created with students over the past two lessons. It should<br></br>
look similar to this:</p><p><strong>Independent Reading</strong></p><ul><li>Focus on reading the entire time.</li><li>Respect other readers.</li><li>Read a variety of genres.</li><li>Record Independent Reading progress in your Reading Log.</li></ul></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Use this chart as a guide to develop the rubric on chart paper about Independent Reading. Create each part of the rubric, beginning with the “Meets the Standards” column, then move to the “Working Toward the Standards” column, and finally, finish with the “Needs Support” column. For example, start with “You are focused on reading the entire time …” and fill in all three categories before moving on to “You respect other readers by following the rituals and routines.” Be sure to write the rubric in language that your students will understand.</p></div><div class="amplifications"><div class="amp swd" data-amplification-type="swd"><div class="col"><div class="amp-content"><p>Check to ensure that all students have access to the information in the rubric. Use multiple means of representing the information (visual presentation of text, TTS [Text-to-Speech], visual supports, and so on).</p></div></div></div><div class="amp ell" data-amplification-type="ell"><div class="col"><h3 data-proficiency-type="Emerging" class="proficiency-heading">Emerging <em class="standard-id" data-display="hidden" data-standard-id="P1.3.6">P1.3.6</em></h3><div class="amp-content"><p>After closely reading the rubric categories, use symbols, numbers, and images as much as you can to construct the rubric. For example, “Meets the Standards” might be a smiley face. “You are focused on reading the entire time” can translate to 100% with a picture of a student reading. Go through the symbols, numbers, and images several times until you are sure Emerging ELLs understand each rating and are confident about how to use the rubric. Start attaching words to the symbols, numbers, and images to support language development. Use the words and symbols, numbers, and images at the same time to create a strong mental connection.</p></div></div></div><div class="amp ell" data-amplification-type="ell"><div class="col"><h3 data-proficiency-type="Expanding" class="proficiency-heading">Expanding <em class="standard-id" data-display="hidden" data-standard-id="P1.3.6">P1.3.6</em></h3><div class="amp-content"><p>Conduct a close reading of the rubric categories. Symbols, numbers, and images will help clarify the rubric categories for Expanding ELLs. However, probe your students to see if they can use words to replace the symbols, numbers, and images in order to put more emphasis on language development. Support your students as they come up with the words. Probe for clarification. Write or type in a visible place so that students can keep track of the rubric they are building.</p></div></div></div><div class="amp ell" data-amplification-type="ell"><div class="col"><h3 data-proficiency-type="Bridging" class="proficiency-heading">Bridging <em class="standard-id" data-display="hidden" data-standard-id="P1.3.6">P1.3.6</em></h3><div class="amp-content"><p>Conduct a close reading of the rubric categories. Make sure Bridging ELLs are able to explain each category using academic language. They should also be able to identify an example for each category.</p></div></div></div></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>As you develop this rubric, stop and ask students to reflect on their own Independent Reading habits.</p></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Make sure that students always have access to the completed rubric.</p></div></li></ul><h5>Rationale</h5><div class="text_section"><div class="content"><p>Co-created rubrics (teacher with students) are effective tools for formative assessment in reading.</p><p>Developing and then assessing with a rubric that defines Independent Reading behaviors helps students understand and internalize the behaviors of proficient readers while also helping you monitor student behavior, identify individual needs, and plan for instruction.</p></div></div></div></li></ul></div></section></div></div><script src="scripts/jquery.js">//</script>
