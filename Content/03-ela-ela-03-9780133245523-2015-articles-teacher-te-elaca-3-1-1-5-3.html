Repeat that a narrative is often called a story. If students have trouble identifying what they already know about writing a narrative piece, gauge their recall by asking what stories they read last year or what stories they wrote.</p></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>In the next task, students will take the assessment. Be prepared to do the following:</p><ul><li>Answer any questions that are not of a substantive nature, providing no additional guidance about the prompt.</li><li>Do a quick thumbs-up/thumbs-down check to ensure that students understand the prompt and are ready to begin writing. Remind students that they will have only 20 minutes to write.</li><li>Tell students to begin working. When the allotted time has elapsed, tell students to stop working.</li><li>If students finish before time is up, direct them to other activities.</li></ul></div><div class="amplifications"><div class="amp ell" data-amplification-type="ell"><div class="col"><h3 data-proficiency-type="Emerging" class="proficiency-heading">Emerging <em class="standard-id" data-display="hidden" data-standard-id="P1.3.5">P1.3.5</em></h3><div class="amp-content"><p>Review the term “narrative.” Define it if necessary.
