Explain the purpose of having discussion guidelines if you notice it is unclear. Assist ELLs at this level to act out and/or draw their thoughts. Consider adding these sketches to your Discussion Rules chart. A drawing might be a picture of one person talking, while someone else is listening. In addition, and especially for students who have difficulty drawing, allow them to work in pairs and to discuss in their native language. Make efforts to form pairs that share the same home language if possible.</p></div></div></div><div class="amp ell" data-amplification-type="ell"><div class="col"><h3 data-proficiency-type="Expanding" class="proficiency-heading">Expanding <em class="standard-id" data-display="hidden" data-standard-id="P1.3.2">P1.3.2</em></h3><div class="amp-content"><p>Make a list of some discussion rules, or guidelines, that you think would help the class have respectful conversations.</p><p>Emphasize the words “rules,” “guidelines,” and “respectful conversations” in the instructions on the student page.</p><p>Expanding ELLs should be sitting next to a partner who speaks his or her home language if possible. They can Turn and Talk about discussion rules in their native language, making connections to culture. Then, they can record the rules using expanded English phrases. Offer a sentence frame that uses the academic vocabulary:</p><p>During a <em>discussion</em>, I am <em>respectful</em> when _____.</p></div></div></div><div class="amp ell" data-amplification-type="ell"><div class="col"><h3 data-proficiency-type="Bridging" class="proficiency-heading">Bridging <em class="standard-id" data-display="hidden" data-standard-id="P1.3.2">P1.3.2</em></h3><div class="amp-content"><p>Circulate among students as they write. Monitor that Bridging ELLs are writing clear rules using complete sentences. Make a mental note of rules that are particularly useful or effective so you can later ask the ELL author to share the rule with the whole group. Encourage those ELLs to share with the large group as this helps them develop their oral skills and become more independent.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="note"><p>Having a discussion about the etiquette surrounding conversations will help students to feel safe sharing during discussions and to respectfully agree and disagree with each other as topics are discussed. The protocols that you co-construct in these lessons with your class surrounding discussion etiquette will set the expectation for all classroom discourse (e.g., Partner Reading, Peer Conferences, Response Groups, Whole Group Share).</p></div></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></section></div></div><script src="scripts/jquery.js">//</script>
