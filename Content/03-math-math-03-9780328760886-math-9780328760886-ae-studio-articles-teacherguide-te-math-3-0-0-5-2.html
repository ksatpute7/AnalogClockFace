	         Explain that all units will have a Gallery of problems for students to choose from. The problems will be about something students learned in the unit. Students may also work with their teacher to review concepts in the unit or pursue the wonderings that they thought of or were shared with the students over the week.

	         Ask students the following.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
		         What things should you consider when you choose a Gallery problem to work on?
	</p>
	 </li>
</ul>

<p>
	         Have students think about the question on their own and then turn and talk to a partner.
</p>
<p>
	         Ask students to share their ideas with the class. List each idea in the Notebook and share with the students. You might also want to write their ideas on a chart; but since students will only need to refer to it when they are working on a gallery lesson, the chart does not have to be posted in a permanent place in the classroom. It is good for students to get used to finding the shared lists about routines and rituals.
</p>
<p>
	         When you have listed all the ideas, review each one for clarity.
</p>
<p>
	         These hints are given to students as ideas about what to consider when choosing a Gallery problem:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
		         Look at each problem before choosing one.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		         Use your understanding of the unitâ€™s math to help you decide on a problem.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li style="margin-left: 20px;">
		<p>
			         If you are confused or unsure, pick an easy problem.
		</p>
		 </li>
		<li style="margin-left: 20px;">
		<p>
			         If you understand the content okay, pick a medium or a difficult problem.
		</p>
		 </li>
		<li style="margin-left: 20px;">
		<p>
			         If you understand the content very well, pick a very difficult problem.
		</p>
		 </li>
	</ul>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		         Choose the problem you find most interesting.
	</p>
	 </li>
</ul>
<p>
	         Show students how to access the Gallery on their tablet.
