In order to  indirectly compare areas, students investigate different ways to find  area. Students learn that area can be measured by finding the number of  unit squares that exactly cover a figure with no gaps and no overlaps.  <br> </p> <p>                                                                                    In <a href="http://cat2-prod.cloudapp.net/Xopus/examples/authoringToolTest/lookup/teachermode/TG-Math-3-9-0-3.xhtml#ch44lev1sec3">Lesson 3</a>,  students are introduced to the square centimeter. They learn that a  square centimeter is a square that is 1 cm long and 1 cm wide. They learn that  this square is 1 square centimeter (1 cm<sup>2</sup>). Students begin to use this standard unit to measure the area of rectangles. <br> </p> <p>                                                                                    In <a href="http://cat2-prod.cloudapp.net/Xopus/examples/authoringToolTest/lookup/teachermode/TG-Math-3-9-0-4.xhtml#ch44lev1sec4">Lessons 4</a> and<a href="http://cat2-prod.cloudapp.net/Xopus/examples/authoringToolTest/lookup/teachermode/TG-Math-3-9-0-5.xhtml#ch44lev1sec5"> 5,</a> students are asked to devise methods for finding the areas of rectangles. In <a href="http://cat2-prod.cloudapp.net/Xopus/examples/authoringToolTest/lookup/teachermode/TG-Math-3-9-0-5.xhtml#ch44lev1sec5">Lesson 5</a>, students learn that they can find area by multiplying the length and the width. <a href="http://cat2-prod.cloudapp.net/Xopus/examples/authoringToolTest/lookup/teachermode/TG-Math-3-9-0-6.xhtml#ch44lev1sec6">Lesson 6</a> connects finding area to the multiplication work students have done and  gives them an opportunity to think explicitly about how they can use  the properties of multiplication to find the area of rectangles. </p> <p>                                                                          Next, students are tasked with finding the area of rectilinear  figures. Since the formulas that they have developed so far can be used  only for rectangles, students will need to devise strategies for finding  the area of a variety of rectilinear figures. </p> <p>                                                                                    Finally,  students investigate figures that have the same area and different  perimeters. They also investigate figures that have the same perimeter  and different areas. Students find all possible perimeters for  rectangles with equal area and then they find possible areas for figures  with the same perimeters. </p> <p>              The lessons are followed by a  two-day Gallery in which students can choose from among a menu of area  tasks. The unit ends with a final assessment. </p> </section> <section class="level2"> <hgroup> <h1 class="title"><span class="label">Contents</span></h1> </hgroup> <ol class="tocentrylist"> <li class="toclevel1"> <p> <a href="TG-Math-3-9-0-1.xhtml#ch44lev1sec1"><span class="title"><span class="label">Lesson </span><span class="number">1: </span>Which Covers More Area?</span> <span class="pageref">8</span></a> </p> <p>                                                                                    Students begin to explore the concept of area as a measurement by comparing the area of two figures. </p> </li> <li class="toclevel1"> <p> <a href="TG-Math-3-9-0-2.xhtml#ch44lev1sec2"><span class="title"><span class="label">Lesson </span><span class="number">2: </span>Which Has the Larger Area?</span> <span class="pageref">14</span></a> </p> <p>                                                                                    Students compare the area of rectangles using squares.
