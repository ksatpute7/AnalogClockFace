Then students choose a partner and a question to investigate for their graphing data project. </p> <p>                                                       Students are familiar with bar graphs, picture graphs, and line plots from second grade. They will extend this knowledge to using a scale with an interval greater than <math><mn>1</mn></math> to “fit” more data into a graph. In Lesson 3 students learn how a scale with an interval greater than <math><mn>1</mn></math> is used in picture graphs. In Lessons 4 and 5, students explore the use of a scale with an interval greater than <math><mn>1</mn></math> in bar graphs. In Lesson 6, students create a line plot. Students construct and interpret graphs for these lessons. </p> <p>                                                       The lessons are followed by a one day Gallery that includes working on their project, where students will apply what they have learned to construct a graph based on data collected from classmates. There are two days for Project Presentations. The unit ends with a final assessment. </p> </section> <section class="level2"><hgroup> <h1 class="title">Contents</h1> </hgroup></section> <ol class="tocentrylist"> <li class="toclevel1"><a href="TG-Math-3-10-0-1.xhtml#ch58lev1sec01"><span class="title"><span class="label">Lesson </span><span class="number">1: </span>How Fast Is Fast?</span> <span class="pageref">7</span></a> <p>                                                       Students will review how data is displayed in bar graphs.
