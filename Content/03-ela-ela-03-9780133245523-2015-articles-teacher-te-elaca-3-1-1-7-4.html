Make sure students understand that there are many ways to write responses to their reading.</p></div></li></ul><h5>Rationale</h5><div class="text_section"><div class="content"><p>This part of the lesson will show students how to write a reading response that demonstrates their thinking about big ideas in the books they are reading. When students read and have an opportunity to respond or write about their reading, they think more deeply about the text. Written responses enhance their comprehension of what they have read.</p></div></div><ul class="content-list"><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Explain that the big idea is what the author wants the reader to learn by reading his or her book. When readers think about the big idea, they are also asking themselves, “What message is the author trying to give to me?”</p></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Ask students to think about the big idea in <em>Boxes for Katje</em>. (Possible answer: <em>When people work together to solve a problem they achieve more than when they work alone. Rosie’s community worked together to help a small community in their time of need.</em>)</p></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Model a written response about the big idea. Think Aloud as you write.</p></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Have students write their own response.</p></div><div class="amplifications"><div class="amp swd" data-amplification-type="swd"><div class="col"><div class="amp-content"><p>Students may struggle with the integration required for this task (e.g., ideation, memory, expression, and motor skills). Allow them to present their thinking in the way that best suits them (e.g., orally, visually, by answering multiple-choice questions, by matching questions to answers, by sequencing a list of events by number).</p></div></div></div><div class="amp ell" data-amplification-type="ell"><div class="col"><h3 data-proficiency-type="Emerging" class="proficiency-heading">Emerging <em class="standard-id" data-display="hidden" data-standard-id="P1.3.11">P1.3.11</em></h3><div class="amp-content"><p>Have Emerging ELLs support their opinions by providing some textual evidence. Students can use the following sentence frames:</p><ul><li>The author wanted us to learn _____. I think this because _____.</li></ul><p>Allow students to write their response in their primary language if they have facility in this. They may add drawings as necessary.</p></div></div></div><div class="amp ell" data-amplification-type="ell"><div class="col"><h3 data-proficiency-type="Expanding" class="proficiency-heading">Expanding <em class="standard-id" data-display="hidden" data-standard-id="P1.3.11">P1.3.11</em></h3><div class="amp-content"><p>Have Expanding ELLs support their opinions by providing good reasons from the text. Pair Expanding ELLs with students who have a higher level of English proficiency. Students can use the following sentence frames:</p><ul><li>In my opinion, the author wanted us to learn _____. The text shows on page _____.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="amp ell" data-amplification-type="ell"><div class="col"><h3 data-proficiency-type="Bridging" class="proficiency-heading">Bridging <em class="standard-id" data-display="hidden" data-standard-id="P1.3.11">P1.3.11</em></h3><div class="amp-content"><p>Have Bridging ELLs support their opinions and persuade others what the lesson of the story is. Encourage students to write down their responses focusing on content, not spelling or grammar.</p></div></div></div></div><div class="note"><p>Be sure to make written responses a regular part of Work Time, using either the Common Reads or the students’ Independent Reading books as material for the responses. Students in third grade should write responses to their reading about three times a week. They should also record what they’ve read in their Reading Logs. Also remind students to rate themselves daily on Independent Reading.</p></div></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></section></div></div><script src="scripts/jquery.js">//</script>
