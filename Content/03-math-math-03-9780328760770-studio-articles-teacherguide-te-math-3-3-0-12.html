You have to multiply the number of chairs in a row by the number of rows.

Instead of writing 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2&nbsp;+ 2 + 2, you can write 8 × 2. </p> <br> <p>                                                                                                                         The meaning of the numbers in a multiplication expression is also special. When you add, all the addends represent the same thing—apples or igloos or pencils. The factors in a multiplication expression do not mean the same thing. The first factor tells you how many of the second factor to count. The second factor tells you the group size that is being counted: 9 × 2 = 18 means 9 twos are 18. </p> </li> <li> <p>                                                                                                                         You can multiply when you want to know how many in all and when the groups are all the same size. For example, you can use multiplication to find the total number of feet of ribbon when there are 5 pieces that are each 3 feet long. </p> </li> <li> <p>                                                                                                                         You cannot multiply when you want to know how many in all and the groups are not all the same size. For example, you have to add when you want to know how many total feet of ribbon there are when there is one 3-foot piece, one 4-foot piece, and one 5-foot piece; you cannot multiply. </p> </li> <li> <p>                                                                                                                         Sometimes you can reorganize the groups to make them all the same size. If you want to know how many fish in all and you have 1 tank with 3 fish, 1 tank with 2 fish, and 1 tank with 3 fish, you can move the fish around so that each tank has 2 fish. Then you can multiply. (You can do this in your head; you don’t actually have to move the fish.) </p> </li> </ol> </section> </section> </section> <section class="bodymatter"> <section id="ch03lev2sec206" class="level2 level2_77"><header> <h1 class="title">Multiplication or Not</h1> </header> <section id="ch03lev3sec276"><header> <h1 class="title">Answer<span class="predefinedtarget" id="ccsoc_pd_answers8"></span></h1> </header> <p>                                                                                           Student feedback for the correct card sort will be generated by the interactive.

Both are multiplication problems. Problem B is not a multiplication problem because the 7 red apples and 5 green apples are two different-sized groups, not 7 groups of 5.
