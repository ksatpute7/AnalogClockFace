The next lesson focuses on the special role of each factor and on using multiplication to represent situations. <a href="TG-MATH-3-3-0-3.xhtml#ch03lev1sec3"><span class="label">Lessons </span><span class="number">3</span></a> and <a href="TG-MATH-3-3-0-4.xhtml#ch03lev1sec4"><span class="number">4</span></a> are devoted to a study of the fives facts. Thereafter, students spend two days on each of these multiplication tables: twos, threes, and fours. The first day of studying a set of facts begins with building that multiplication table. Students look for structure, both in the multiplication table and in a chart by shading multiples. They begin to develop an understanding that as the number of groups increases by one, the product increases by the number in each group. Students begin the second day of each two-day focus by reciting a multiplication facts chant. They also develop understanding of the types of situations in which multiplication is useful. As the lessons progress, students encounter multiplication in the form of equal groups, equal lengths, equal distances, and arrays. On the second day of each two-day focus, students also practice writing and illustrating multiplication stories. </p> <p>                               While the focus of the unit is on understanding multiplication conceptually, students are also expected to attain fluency with the multiplication facts. By the end of the unit, students should be fluent with the fives, twos, threes, and fours. Knowledge of these facts and of the properties will be important prerequisites for the Multiplying 6, 7, 8 and 9 and Mastering Multiplication units. </p> </section> <nav id="tocd1e10etm_se_pt03" class="toc"><section class="level2"><header> <h1 class="title"><span class="label">Contents</span></h1> </header> <p class="subtitle marginalia">                               To navigate this document, click below on any of the lesson titles. </p> <div class="tocproductfrontmatter"> <ol class="tocentrylist"> <li class="toclevel1"> <p class="marginalia"> <a href="#ch00"><span class="title">Common Core State Standards for Mathematics</span> <span class="pageref">5</span></a> </p> </li> <li class="toclevel1"> <p class="marginalia"> <a href="#intro01a"><span class="title">Unit Overview</span> <span class="pageref">9</span></a> </p> </li> </ol> </div> <div class="tocproductbodymatter"> <ol class="tocentrylist"> <li class="toclevel1"> <p> <a href="TG-MATH-3-3-0-1.xhtml#ch03lev1sec1"><span class="label">Lesson </span><span class="number">1:</span> How Many Fingers? <span class="pageref">10</span></a> </p> <p>                               Students will find different ways to represent the number of fingers in the class.
