They find a classmate whose card has a number equal to theirs to determine the partner they will work with for the week. The class decides on classroom norms that they think will make the classroom a good place to learn for everyone. Students learn the basic features of the tablet as they work on a problem about expanded form. </p> </section> <section id="ch05lev3sec1"><header> <h1 class="title">Content Standards</h1> </header>This unit focuses on prerequisites of the following standards:<section id="ch05lev4sec1"><header> <h1 class="title">3.

If they will be working at their desks or tables, be specific about which items should be visible in their work areas. </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>                                Decide on hand signals or phrases to tell students to go to the whole-class meeting area and technology pause routing to stop their work, put the technology to the side, and focus attention on you. </p> </li> <li> <p>                                Identify locations in the classroom for the charts that will be created during the introduction unit. </p> </li> </ul> <section><span class="leadin leadin_lc_1">ELL: </span> <p>                                Using tools such as counters and base-10 blocks is especially important for ELLs. These tools give students a way to construct models of abstract mathematical ideas and develop a deeper understanding of the math concepts. </p> </section> </section> </section>  <!-- ################################## EPISODE 0 LESSON 1 TASK 1 ############################################# --> <!-- ################################## EPISODE 0 LESSON 1 TASK 2 ############################################# --> <!-- ################################## EPISODE 0 LESSON 1 TASK 3 ############################################# --> <!-- ################################## EPISODE 0 LESSON 1 TASK 4 ############################################# --> <!-- ################################## EPISODE 0 LESSON 1 TASK 5 ############################################# --> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>   </body></html>
