<p>
	    Have each student read the instructions first, then go to the Gallery lesson to choose a Gallery problem to work on. Give students time to work. When they are finished, have students return to task 5 in this lesson to discuss their work.
</p>
<p>
	 <strong>Represent a Math Problem</strong>
</p>
<p>
	            Students explore the math tools that are available in the Notebook—Number Line tool, Tape Diagram tool, and Hundred Chart tool. They solve a problem about the number of cats playing in a barn using one of the tools.
</p>
<p>
	 <strong>Explore Numbers </strong>
</p>
<p>
	            Students will research comparing numbers greater than 100.
</p>
<p>
	 <strong>Work With Your Notebook</strong>
</p>
<p>
	            Students explore the features of the Notebook drawing area. They solve a problem about the length of a bookshelf using these features.
</p>

<p>
	            In forming pairs, be aware of ELLs and ensure that they will have a learning environment where they can be productive. Sometimes, pair them up with native speakers so they can learn from native counterparts’ language skills. Other times, pair them up with students who are at the same level of language skills, so they can take a more active role and they can work things out together. Yet, other times, pair them up with students whose proficiency level is lower, so they play the role of the supporter. You can also pair them up based on their math proficiency (not just the language proficiency).

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
		            Students spend time understanding the problem before starting their work. They persevere through difficulty to successfully complete the problem they choose.
