Check that students understand that the problem is asking them to check Jasper and Kentasha’s work and describe their reasoning.

Ask: </p> <ul> <li> <p>                    What is going to be most helpful when you notice an error? </p> </li> <li> <p>                    Would laughing be helpful to the student? </p> </li> <li> <p>                    What about bragging that you know the answer? </p> </li> <li> <p>                    What about describing your reasons for disagreeing with the answer? </p> </li> </ul> <p>                    Emphasize that it is important for students to notice their mistakes and be accepting of them, because students can learn from them. Tell students not to be hesitant about sharing their mistakes with the whole class. Explain that when a student shares a mistake, everyone learns. </p> <p>                    Take a few moments to demonstrate how to go to the Notebook on the tablet and how to record work. Explain that students can copy an image (such as a picture in the problem) to their Notebook so that the problem is recorded with their completed work. Students will see the shared list of classroom norms that the class agreed on. </p> <p>                    Tell students to work on the problem individually. Use a verbal clue such as “Do it now” or “You may begin.” </p> <p>                    Note that using clear commands or verbal instructions is helpful for students. They often do not know when to begin moving their materials or when to switch from listening to you to working on a task. Often they will begin working before listening to all of the directions. Teach students that you will use a phrase such as “Do it now” to signal that they can start the task. Make sure you are consistent in the phrase you use. </p> <p>                    After students have worked a few minutes on their own, tell them to compare their work with that of their partner. </p> <p>                    As students work, listen to and observe their interactions with each other. Do not be too quick to offer additional help. Allow individual “struggle time.” </p> <section><span class="leadin leadin_lc_2">SWD:</span> <p>                    Some students may need to share their work through drawings or by using materials such as base-10 blocks. Another option is to have students make a voice recording of their explanation in their Notebook. </p> <p>             Provide a safe setting for students with disabilities to ask questions  about any misconceptions they may have. It is critical that students  feel safe enough to share their ideas, strategies, and, most  importantly, mistakes. It is important that you provide feedback, using  gestures and prompting, to elicit responses. </p> </section> </section> <section id="ch05lev3sec10"><header> <h1 class="title">Mathematical Practices</h1> </header> <p> <span class="strong">            Mathematical Practice 3: Construct viable arguments and critique the reasoning of others. </span> </p> <ul> <li> <p>                    As students think about and compare Jasper and Kentasha’s work, students identify mistakes that will help them better understand how to write numbers in expanded form. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <span class="strong">             Mathematical Practice 6: Attend to precision. </span> </p> <ul> <li> <p>                    Students identify errors in student work and explain their reasoning clearly and completely. </p> </li> </ul> </section> <section id="ch05lev3sec11"><header> <h1 class="title">Interventions<span class="predefinedtarget" id="ccsoc_pd_interventions1"></span></h1> </header> <p> <span class="strong">Student has difficulty with the technology.</span> </p> <ul> <li> <p>                    Work with your partner to figure out how to use the technology. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <span class="strong">Student does not understand expanded form.</span> </p> <ul> <li> <p>                    Tell your partner how you can use drawings or a manipulative to help you show the hundreds, tens, and ones in 426. </p> </li> </ul> <p> <span class="strong">Student does not explain Jasper’s thinking.</span> </p> <ul> <li> <p>                    What thinking does Jasper use to write the expanded form of 426? </p> </li> <li> <p>                    Explain how Jasper uses hundreds, tens, and ones to write 426 in expanded form? </p> </li> </ul> <p> <span class="strong">Student does not explain Kentasha’s thinking.</span> </p> <ul> <li> <p>                    What thinking does Kentasha use to write the expanded form of 426? </p> </li> <li> <p>                    Explain how Kentasha uses hundreds, tens, and ones to write 426 in expanded form? </p> </li> </ul> <p> <span class="strong">Student does not notice Kentasha’s mistake.</span> </p> <ul> <li> <p>                    Look closely at the students’ work.
