Try to clear up confusing parts.</li><li>Look for fragments.</li><li>Think about what the reader will need to know.</li><li>Add or delete information.</li><li>Move things around.</li><li>Give feedback to and receive feedback from others (Response Groups, Writer Conferences, Partner Reading, Author’s Chair).</li><li>Think carefully about word choice (strong verbs, descriptive adjectives, and adverbs).</li><li>Check for run-on sentences.</li><li>Consider using conjunctions to make the meaning of some sentences clearer.</li><li>Look at the work of mentor authors.</li></ul></div><div class="amplifications"><div class="amp swd" data-amplification-type="swd"><div class="col"><div class="amp-content"><p>If students need additional support, give them a revising and editing checklist to work through while making revisions.
