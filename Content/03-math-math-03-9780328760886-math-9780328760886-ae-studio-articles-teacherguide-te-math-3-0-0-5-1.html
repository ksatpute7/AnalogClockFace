Practicing these rituals and routines strengthens students’ mathematical character by providing them with strategies for approaching mathematical situations and for working together to build a mathematical community. </p> <figure id="ch05unfig38" class="informalfigure marginalia"> <img alt="" src="03-math-math-03-9780328760886-math-9780328760886-ae-studio-articles-images-p49-1.jpg" width="246" height="185"> </figure> <p>             Ask students the following question. </p> <ul> <li> <p>             What else can you do to be active in class and take responsibility for your own learning? </p> </li> </ul> <p>             Have students think about the question individually and then turn and talk to their partner. </p> <figure id="ch05unfig39" class="informalfigure marginalia"> <img alt="" src="03-math-math-03-9780328760886-math-9780328760886-ae-studio-articles-images-p49-2.jpg" width="246" height="186"> </figure> <p>             If students are having trouble thinking of ideas, suggest that they think about the different parts of class time and the different ways they work during those times: working individually, working with partners, the Ways of Thinking discussion, and so on.

The simplicity and predictability of the routines help students feel more proactive and confident in the classroom. </p> </section></section><br> <br>   </body></html>
