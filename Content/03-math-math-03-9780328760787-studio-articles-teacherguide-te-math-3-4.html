	                                        Students should be able to:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
		                              Recognize two-dimensional (2-D) shapes: quadrilaterals, squares, and rectangles
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		                              Understand units of length, finding differences in lengths, and adding lengths

<h1 class="title">Lesson Flow</h1>
 </header>
<p>
	                                         After an initial exploratory lesson that reminds students of the  definition and characteristics of a quadrilateral, the unit focuses on  characteristics of different quadrilaterals: rectangles, squares, and  rhombuses.
</p>
<p>
	                                        Students know from second grade that rectangles have  four right angles. In this unit, students refine their definition of  rectangles to include having opposite sides of the same length. This  definition is applied to squares, and students discover that squares are  rectangles.
</p>
<p>
	                                        In second grade students learned how to find the  perimeter of shapes. In this unit, they use the knowledge that opposite  sides (or all four sides) of a rectangle are the same length to find  the perimeter of rectangles.
</p>
<p>
	                                        Lastly, students are introduced to  rhombuses and find that a square is a rhombus. Students also calculate  perimeter for rhombuses. There is a two-day Gallery, where students  investigate other topics related to quadrilaterals. The unit ends with a  Unit Assessment.

	                                        This unit focuses on the following Common Core State Standards for Mathematics:

<p>
	 <span class="strong">Geometric measurement: recognize perimeter as an attribute of plane figures and distinguish between linear and area measures</span>.
</p>
<p>
	                                       8. Solve real world and mathematical  problems involving perimeters of polygons, including finding the  perimeter given the side lengths, finding an unknown side length, and  exhibiting rectangles with the same perimeter and different areas or  with the same area and different perimeters.
</p>
 </section> <section id="ch03div02"><header>
<h1 class="title">3.G—Geometry</h1>

</p>
<p>
	                                       1. Understand that shapes in different  categories (e.g., rhombuses, rectangles, and others) may share  attributes (e.g., having four sides), and that the shared attributes can  define a larger category (e.g., quadrilaterals). Recognize rhombuses,  rectangles, and squares as examples of quadrilaterals, and draw examples  of quadrilaterals that do not belong to any of these subcategories.
