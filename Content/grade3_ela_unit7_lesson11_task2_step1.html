                        <p>Read the table of contents in <em>Turtles &amp; Tortoises</em>. The table of contents page can help you predict how a book might be organized or structured. It is helpful to think about what you know and expect to find before you begin reading. This is called &#8220;activating background knowledge.&#8221; This helps you pull together information before you read to help you better understand what you read.</p><p>Follow along as your teacher reads aloud <em>Turtles &amp; Tortoises</em>. Listen as your teacher points out text structures. </p><p>Like your own poster, <em>Turtles</em>&nbsp;<em>&amp; Tortoises </em>presents information about an animal, discusses problems with this animal in communities, and offers helpful solutions.</p><p>You may want to use some of the text structures you see in <em>Turtles</em>&nbsp;<em>&amp; Tortoises</em> in your poster project.</p>
