Refer students to the Partner Work poster you made and posted in the classroom (see <a href="TE-Math-3-0-0-2.xhtml#ch05lev1sec2" class="xref"><span class="label">Lesson </span><span class="number">2</span></a> Preparation). </p> <p>         Also remind students that when they notice a mistake it is most helpful to ask clarifying questions and explain your reasons for disagreeing. It is not helpful to laugh or tease when you notice a mistake. </p> <figure id="ch05unfig10" class="informalfigure marginalia"> <img alt="" src="03-math-math-03-9780328760886-math-9780328760886-ab-studio-articles-images-p20-1.jpg" height="187" width="248"> </figure> <p>         Today, students will work with a partner to match a riddle with its solution. </p> <p>         Project the Riddles Card Match interactive. Have a student read the instructions aloud. Then model the task with a student partner. </p> <ul> <li> <p>         I see two kinds of cards: riddle cards and number cards. I need to match each riddle card with a number card. </p> </li> <li> <p>         My partner and I will choose a riddle card to work on. We each work individually to find the correct answer. (For this the demonstration you will just work on one match. A good riddle to use is “I am 500. I have 9 tens and 10 ones. How many hundreds do I have?”) </p> </li> <li> <p>         After we each solve the riddle, we compare our matches. We explain to each other why we think the cards match. We should ask questions if we are unclear about each other’s reasoning. (Pick “4” as the match. Explain to your partner: “90 plus 10 is 100 so to get to 500 I need 4 hundreds.” If your partner does not have any questions, encourage other students to challenge your explanation. </p> <p>         They might say: “You didn’t explain where the 90 and the 10 in your explanation came from.”) </p> </li> <li> <p>         Once we agree on the answer, we choose another riddle to solve. </p> </li> </ul> <p>         Tell students that after they have solved all the riddles by themselves and compared their work with their partner's, they will prepare their presentation. As they work on their presentation, they will clarify and improve their work. </p> <section> <span class="leadin leadin_lc_2">SWD:</span> <p>         Help students with disabilities to build their mathematical vocabulary by continually modeling the use of new terms in the context of classroom work and activities. </p> </section> </section> </section>   </body></html>
