This linguistic knowledge offers both benefits and drawbacks. In some cases, they may know a cognate that assists them. In other cases, the phonological and orthographic transfer will cause spelling errors.</p><ul><li>In order to assist ELLs, begin with offering a visual of the spelling words when possible. Then, when they take the pre-test, be certain they rewrite the full word for the ones they missed (rather than just noting specific letter errors).</li><li>To improve and prepare for the test, offer a cloze procedure for support. Pair the ELL with a strong ELA student who is English proficient and have the ELL write the missed word. Then, below the word, have the non-ELL peer write the word again several times with progressively more letters replaced by a blank space. Have the ELL fill in the blanks to complete the word to gradually reach the correct spelling of each word.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="amp ell" data-amplification-type="ell"><div class="col"><h3 data-proficiency-type="Expanding" class="proficiency-heading">Expanding <em class="standard-id" data-display="hidden" data-standard-id="P1.5.6bEx">P1.5.6bEx</em></h3><div class="amp-content"><p>The amplification in the Emerging level also applies for this level.</p></div></div></div><div class="amp ell" data-amplification-type="ell"><div class="col"><h3 data-proficiency-type="Bridging" class="proficiency-heading">Bridging <em class="standard-id" data-display="hidden" data-standard-id="P1.5.6bBr">P1.5.6bBr</em></h3><div class="amp-content"><p>The amplification in the Emerging level also applies for this level.</p></div></div></div><div class="amp sel" data-amplification-type="sel"><div class="col"><div class="amp-content"><p>Additional activities may be added to the weekly routines to support language development.</p><ul><li>When introducing new word patterns, enunciate clearly all sounds in each of the words on the list for the week.</li><li>Model for students how to pronounce each word correctly and how to use each word in a sentence.</li><li>Help students practice correct pronunciation.</li><li>Draw students’ attention to the part(s) of each word that follows the spelling or sound pattern for the week.</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="amp swd" data-amplification-type="swd"><div class="col"><div class="amp-content"><p>Use each student’s Individualized Education Program (IEP) as a guide to determine which of the following strategies will provide maximum support throughout the week.
