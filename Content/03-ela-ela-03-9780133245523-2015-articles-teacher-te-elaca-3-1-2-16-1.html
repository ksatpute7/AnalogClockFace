What are they? (<em>incinerate, bury, recycle</em>)<br></br>
Based on this information, what do you think <em>incinerate</em> might mean? Allow volunteers to share their ideas, and then explain that incinerate means to burn completely.</li></ul><ul><li>Ask: Where is our school located? Explain that <em>located</em> means to be in a particular place. Use this sentence from the Common Read to further illustrate the meaning of this word: “Some communities are located on islands or high up on mountains.” Ask students: Where is your favorite park located?</li><li>Ask: What does an extension cord help you to do? (<em>It makes the electrical cord longer</em>.) Then read aloud the following sentence from <em>What is a Community? from A to Z</em>: “There are many kinds of families—two-parent families, single-parent families, foster families, and extended families.”<br></br>
Say to students: Using what you know about the word <em>extension</em>, what do you think an <em>extended</em> family is? Elicit from the students that an extended family would be one made larger by additional family members, such as grandparents or cousins.</li></ul></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Remind students to enter the three words into their Personal Notebook and to write a short definition for each.</p></div></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></section></div></div><script src="scripts/jquery.js">//</script>
