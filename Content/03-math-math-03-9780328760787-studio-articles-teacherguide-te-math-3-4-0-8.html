One way to locate two other vertices is to count the number of units between the given points. Because there are six grid squares between given points and all four line segments of a square are congruent, the other two vertices must be six units from the given vertices. To correctly place the vertices, students must understand that the distance from one intersection to the adjacent intersection is the same as the distance from one midpoint to the adjacent midpoint. </p> <p>                                                                                On the second grid, the line connecting the given points is a diagonal line. To complete a square in which the given points are adjacent vertices, students must draw diagonal lines that are the same length as the diagonal line that connects the given points. </p> <figure id="ch03unfig85" class="informalfigure"> <img src="03-math-math-03-9780328760787-studio-articles-images-mth-3-4-gl_tch_pointsofasquare2.jpg"> </figure> <p> <span class="strong">Treating the given points as adjacent vertices</span> </p> <p>                                                                                On the first grid, to make a square in which the given points form opposite vertices, extend diagonal lines from each given vertex until they meet.

The other two vertices can be found by drawing a vertical line up from the lower dot and a horizontal line right from the upper dot, and then drawing a vertical line down from the upper dot and a horizontal line left from the lower dot.

Start by connecting the given dots in each grid with a line segment. Then draw lines that intersect the connecting line segment at 90° angles to each of the given vertices. Now any line that runs parallel to the original line and intersects the lines that run at 90° angles to the original line will finish a rectangle. The points where the lines meet are the rectangle’s missing vertices. The answer here shows one possible placement of the vertices for each grid using this view of the given points. </p> <figure id="ch03unfig87" class="informalfigure"> <img src="03-math-math-03-9780328760787-studio-articles-images-mth-3-4-gl_tch_pointsofectangle2.jpg"> </figure></section></section><section id="ch03lev2sec116" class="level2"> <header> <h1 class="title">Perimeter of a Rectangle</h1> </header><section class="practice" id="ch03lev3sec149"> <header> <h1 class="title">Answer</h1> <h1 class="title"><span class="predefinedtarget" id="ccsoc_pd_answers24"></span></h1> </header> <ol> <li>The rectangle has a perimeter of 30 units.</li> <li> <p>                                                                                Because the perimeter of the square is 12 units and 4 x 3 = 12, one side must be 3 units long. </p> <p>                                                                                By measuring the one side of the square and the length and width of the rectangle, you can find that the rectangle is the same width as the square and 4 times as long. </p> <figure id="ch03unfig88" class="informalfigure"> <img src="03-math-math-03-9780328760787-studio-articles-images-mth-3-4-gl_tch_perimeterofarectangle.jpg"> </figure> <p>                                                                                12 + 12 + 3 + 3 = 30 </p> <p>                                                                                The perimeter of the rectangle is 30 units long. </p> </li> </ol> </section></section><section id="ch03lev2sec117" class="level2"> <header> <h1 class="title">Quadrilaterals and Triangles</h1> </header><section class="practice" id="ch03lev3sec150"> <header> <h1 class="title">Possible Answers</h1> </header> <p>                                                                                Students will become familiar with the sketch. </p> <ol type="1"> <li> <p>                                                                                The two triangles always have different sizes or shapes.
