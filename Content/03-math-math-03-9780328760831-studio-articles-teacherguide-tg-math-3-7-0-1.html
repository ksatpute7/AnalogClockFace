	                                                        Students use the Packing Blocks interactive to explore the  relationship between multiplication and division. They intuitively  approach the concept of division by thinking of a number as the product  of two factors. They use the interactive to explore the possible factor  pairs of a number. Students chant with the animation to review the twos.

	 </strong>
</p>
 <strong>Represent and solve problems involving multiplication and division.<br>
 </strong><br>
                                             2. Interpret whole-number quotients of whole numbers, e.g., interpret <math> <mrow> <mn>56</mn><mo>÷</mo><mn>8</mn></mrow> </math> as the number of objects in each share when 56 objects are partitioned equally into 8 shares, or as a number of shares when 56 objects are partitioned into equal shares of 8 objects each. For example, describe a context in which a number of shares or a number of groups can be expressed as <math> <mrow> <mn>56</mn><mo>÷</mo><mn>8</mn></mrow> </math> .<br>
 <br>
                                             3. Use multiplication and division within 100 to solve word problems in situations involving equal groups, arrays, and measurement quantities, e.g., by using drawings and equations with a symbol for the unknown number to represent the problem.<br>
 <br>
                                             4. Determine the unknown whole number in a multiplication or division equation relating three whole numbers. For example, determine the unknown number that makes the equation true in each of the equations <math> <mrow> <mn>8</mn><mo>×</mo><mo>☐</mo><mo>=</mo><mn>48</mn><mo>,</mo><mtext> </mtext><mn>5</mn><mo>=</mo><mo>☐</mo><mo>÷</mo><mn>3</mn><mo>,</mo><mtext> </mtext><mn>6</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>6</mn><mo>=</mo><mo>☐   </mo></mrow> </math>.<strong><br>
 <br>
                                             Understand properties of multiplication and the relationship between multiplication and division.</strong><br>
 <br>
                                             6. Understand division as an unknown-factor problem. For example, find <math> <mrow> <mn>32</mn><mo>÷</mo><mn>8</mn></mrow> </math> by finding the number that makes 32 when multiplied by 8.<strong><br>
 <br>
                                             Multiply and divide within 100.</strong><br>
 <br>
                                             7. Fluently multiply and divide within 100, using strategies such as the relationship between multiplication and division (e.g., knowing that <math> <mrow> <mn>8</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>5</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>40</mn></mrow></math>, one knows <math> <mrow> <mn>40</mn><mo>÷</mo><mn>5</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>8</mn></mrow></math>) or properties of operations. By the end of Grade 3, know from memory all products of two one-digit numbers. <section>

	                                             Multiplication and division are inverse operations. That is,  the process of multiplying by 4 and the process of dividing by 4 “undo”  each other. Given the special roles of the multiplier and  multiplicand, each multiplication leads to two different divisions. The  multiplication <math> <mrow> <mn>8</mn><mo>×</mo><mn>7</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>56</mn></mrow> </math> leads to both of these divisions:<math>&nbsp;  <mrow> <mn>56</mn><mo>÷</mo><mn>8</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>7</mn></mrow> </math> and <math> <mrow> <mn>56</mn><mo>÷</mo><mn>7</mn><mo>=</mo><mn>8</mn></mrow> </math>.

	                                                       There are two types of division situations:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
		                                Division to find the number of objects in each group, called  “partitive” or sharing division. In sharing situations, the number of  groups is known and division is used to find the size of each group.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		                               Division to find the number of groups, called “quotitive” or  measurement division. In measurement situations, the size of the groups  is known and division is used to find the number of groups.
	</p>
	 </li>
</ul>
<p>
	                                                       In both types of situations, there is some total quantity that is to be distributed equally.
