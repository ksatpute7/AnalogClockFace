Students will learn several routines that will be used throughout the year. They will also read their first Common Read, <em>Boxes for Katje</em>.</p><p><strong>Episode 2: Learning Through Informational Text (Lessons 10–20)</strong></p><p>In this episode, students will continue to learn about informational texts and read another Common Read, <em>What is a Community? from A to Z</em>. They will explore the meaning of community. They will also start to work on their class project—interviewing and reporting on a member of their school community.</p><p><strong>Episode 3: Forming Opinions (Lessons 21–30)</strong></p><p>In this episode, students will refresh their opinion-writing skills. They will explore the concept of community by learning about chimpanzees in the wild and reading two more Common Reads: “Watching in the Wild” and “Pet Primates: Why Not?” They will also learn several more routines, including Guided Reading and Book Clubs.</p></div></div><div class="section accomplishments"><h2 class="section-title">Accomplishments</h2><div class="field_content  section-content"><ol><li>Create and post a list of classroom guidelines.</li><li>Learn to write narrative, informational, and opinion pieces like the ones students read in this unit.</li><li>Understand the broader meaning of communities in other parts of the world.</li></ol></div></div><div class="section guiding-questions"><h2 class="section-title">Guiding Questions</h2><div class="field_content  section-content"><p>These questions are a guide to stimulate thinking, discussion, and writing on the themes and ideas in the unit.

In addition, consider the following:</p><p>For students with disabilities (SWD):</p><p>Some diverse classrooms may include students who are deaf or hearing impaired. Some students who have a hearing impairment use American Sign Language for their communication needs; some students wear hearing aids or have cochlear implants to amplify sounds. Deaf and hearing-impaired students will have an IEP with accommodations and strategies to use in the inclusive setting. Any student with an identified disability (which incorporates a wide range of possibilities) will have an IEP with accommodations that should be addressed individually. In addition, the following accommodations will be helpful:</p><ul><li>Provide preferential seating that allows the student a clear view of the teacher and any charts, graphics, or other teaching materials.</li><li>Be aware of excessive noise in the classroom, such as pencil sharpeners, group discussions, fans, and music, since the technology used to assist hearing-impaired students picks up and amplifies all sounds.</li><li>Provide support and appropriate equipment when students need to access sounds on their device.</li><li>Maintain eye contact with your students to ensure they are able to see your face when you speak, as some students with hearing impairments also attend to facial expressions and lip-reading to gather information.</li></ul><p>For standard English learners (SEL):</p><p>As SELs are ethnic native speakers of English whose mastery of the standard English language used in the curriculum and discourse of schools is limited due to their use of ethnic-specific nonstandard dialects, focus on providing opportunities for meaningful access. Consider the following:</p><ul><li>Properly identify which students are SELs.</li><li>Honor the dialect of the home. Emphasize that mastery of standard academic English does not equate to rejecting the language used by their families in the home or community.</li><li>Accentuate the ability to switch registers as an asset—dependent upon several variables such as audience, task, purpose, setting, social relationship, and mode of communication (written versus spoken).</li></ul><p>For English language learners (ELL):</p><ul><li>Value each student’s native or home language, and encourage the continued development of those languages. When possible, allow students to partner with students who speak the same language or allow students to share in their home or native language.</li><li>When possible, provide opportunities for newcomer ELLs to read or listen to texts in their home language that are the same as those they read in English or that are related to the content.</li><li>Explain to students (and families or guardians, if necessary) that eye contact is valued and okay in academic culture. Do not insist on eye contact during whole group instruction, but do encourage students on an individual basis to make eye contact.</li><li>Differentiation for ELLs is based on students’ prior literacy experiences, the similarities between their home languages and English, and their oral proficiency in English.</li></ul><p><strong>SWD:</strong> In this guide, task-specific accommodations and differentiation for SWDs (students with disabilities) appear with the applicable content when selected.</p><p><strong>SEL:</strong> In this guide, task-specific accommodations and differentiation for SELs appear with the applicable content. Standard English learners include speakers of ethnic-specific nonstandard dialects such as African American English and Chicana/Chicano English; Hawaiian American, Native American, and Asian American students.</p><p><strong>ELL:</strong> In this guide, task-specific amplifications and differentiation for ELLs (English language learners) appear with the applicable content when selected. Amplifications are proficiency-based and aligned to English Language Development standards for Emerging, Bridging, and Expanding levels. They address ELL pedagogy and cultural connections, and may include optional minilessons providing reinforcement for success in the task.</p></div></div><div class="section benchmark-assessment-cold-read"><h2 class="section-title">Benchmark Assessment: Cold Read</h2><div class="field_content  section-content"><p>During this unit, on a day of your choosing, you will administer a Cold Read to assess students’ reading comprehension. For this assessment, students read a text they have never seen before and then respond to multiple-choice and constructed-response questions. When you are ready to administer the Cold Read, give students the assessment passcode and ask them to access the System Tray from the top left corner of their devices. Make sure all students are able to find and open the correct assessment. The assessment will take approximately 45–55 minutes.</p></div></div><div class="section more-to-explore"><h2 class="section-title">More to Explore</h2><div class="field_content  section-content"><p>A rich resource collection is available to you and your students in the More to Explore section of the Pearson System of Courses. Access More to Explore in any lesson by tapping the books icon found in the top right corner of the screen. Take some time to familiarize yourself with these resources, which include Topic Readings (articles, videos, and documents relevant to the theme of the unit), Independent Readings (a library of e-books and suggested readings for students to pursue on their own), and Claims and Quests (open-ended challenges for students to research and analyze alone or in small groups). The Beyond the Classroom section has links to educational websites, museums, and productivity tools that can facilitate research and presentations, and can be accessed for free on the web. Before beginning a unit, review the content in More to Explore and discover ways to enhance student learning. More to Explore can also be accessed from any device at home or in school via the web at <a class="internal-link single-sign-on display-in-app" href="http://v2www.more-to-explore.com/" target="_blank">more-to-explore.com</a>.</p><p><small>*Note that a More to Explore page does not exist for the mini-units.</small></p></div></div><div class="section vocabulary-games"><h2 class="section-title">Vocabulary Games</h2><div class="field_content  section-content"><p>The Pearson System of Courses provides a word game called Blob Busters for Grades 3 through 8 to enhance students’ vocabulary skills.</p><p>There is another version of Blob Busters (with a larger vocabulary database) in More to Explore. Additionally, there is a hangman-style game called “What’s the Word?” in More to Explore for Grades 2 through 12.</p><p>You will find user manuals for both games in Teacher Support. Review these prior to introducing the games to students. Students can be directed to play these games when they finish class work early or as a part of their homework.</p></div></div><div class="section additional-notes"><h2 class="section-title">Additional Notes</h2><div class="field_content  section-content"><ul><li>Additional materials (Annotations; Instructions, Guidelines, and Samples; Rubrics; Handouts; and Assessments) are available in the Prepare Your Lesson section of Teacher Support. Some of these resources may be required for this unit. Teacher Support is accessible via the System Tray or the Teacher Dashboard.</li><li>Students will have an ongoing writing assignment (or assignments) where they draft, share, and revise their writing over the course of multiple lessons. Depending on your preferences and resources, you can have your class do this in the Notebook, in a third-party word-processing application, or on paper.</li><li>Grades 3–4 Routine Times: For each lesson, Opening should take 5–15 minutes, Work Time 65–70 minutes, and Closing 5–10 minutes.
