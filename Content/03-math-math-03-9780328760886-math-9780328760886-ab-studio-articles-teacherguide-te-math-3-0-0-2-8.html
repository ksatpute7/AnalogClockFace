	      Have the students you identified during Preparing for Ways of Thinking share their presentations. Remind students about the ways you expect them to react to any mistakes.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
		      Ask clarifying questions.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		      Explain reasons for disagreeing with the answer.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		      Do not laugh or tease the presenter.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		      Use mistakes as an opportunity to learn.
	</p>
	 </li>
</ul>

	      Have presenters explain how they know the cards match and explain why they found the riddle to be the most difficult. Ask the class the following questions.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
		      How is this strategy similar to the one you used? How is it different?
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		      What questions can you ask the presenters in order to better understand their ideas?
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		      Is there another way you can separate the number into hundreds, tens, and ones?
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		      Did you choose the same riddle? Do you agree that it is the most difficult one? Why or why not?
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		      Are there any new ideas that you might want to try yourself if you play the game again?
	</p>
	 </li>
</ul>
<p>
	      Make links between students’ different approaches and highlight the variability in the strategies that students used.
</p>
<p>
	      Ask a few students who completed the Challenge Problem to present their riddles for the class to solve.
</p>
<p>
	      Then focus the discussion on working with a partner. Ask partners who initially disagreed about a solution to share their conversation. Ask the following questions.
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
		      How did one partner critique the other’s reasoning?
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		      How did partners justify their ideas?
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		      Did they finally come to agreement? If so, how?
	</p>
	 </li>
</ul>
<p>
	      End the discussion by asking students if there are any guidelines they would like to add to their charts about working with a partner, preparing presentations, or class norms. Add any new suggestions to the appropriate charts.

<p>
	      The important mathematics in this lesson is that a number can be represented in different ways. Help students to see that these novel ways of representing the numbers is just as accurate as the standard expanded form representation that they are familiar with.

	  The hints on the student screen help model for students productive questions to ask during Ways of Thinking. You can see these sample questions by opening the hint on the student screen.
