Offer encouragement to ELLs who feel timid or who might be uncomfortable. Celebrate their uniqueness, as well as find commonalities in the group. This will assist those who originate from a more collectivist culture than an individualist culture. Do not force students to share their autobiography orally. Let them listen as the group shares and have them compare the autobiographies they hear to their own using silent reading.</p></div></div></div></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Ask questions such as, “Do we have mystery lovers in our class?
