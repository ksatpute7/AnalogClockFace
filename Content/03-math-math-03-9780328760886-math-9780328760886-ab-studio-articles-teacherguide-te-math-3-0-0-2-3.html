Chan and Zoe’s presentations share their work on that problem. </p> <p>         Refer students to the image of Chan and Zoe’s student presentations. </p> <p>         Have a couple students read Chan and Zoe’s presentation aloud. </p> <figure id="ch05unfig09" class="informalfigure marginalia"> <img alt="" src="03-math-math-03-9780328760886-math-9780328760886-ab-studio-articles-images-p19-1.jpg" height="187" width="248"> </figure> <p>         Ask students to compare the presentations. </p> <ul> <li> <p>         Do you think one of these presentations is better than the other?

Record students’ suggestions on chart paper in a permanent location of the classroom. </p> <p>         Point out that there are two “steps” to presentations: preparing them and presenting them. Ask students the following question. </p> <ul> <li> <p>         How can you give a good presentation? </p> </li> </ul> <p>         These Hints are given to students as ideas about how to prepare clear presentations. </p> <ul> <li> <p>         Understand your own work. </p> </li> <li> <p>         Use visuals and gestures to help others know what you are talking about. </p> </li> <li> <p>         Say fewer words and choose them carefully. </p> </li> <li> <p>         Speak clearly and slowly. </p> </li> <li> <p>         Stay calm. Remember to breathe. </p> </li> <li> <p>         Listen carefully to comments and questions. </p> </li> <li> <p>         Pause to think about your response before speaking. </p> </li> </ul> <p>         Add students’ ideas to the chart of what makes a good presentation. After students finish sharing their ideas, review each suggestion for clarity. It is not necessary that students agree on each suggestion; diversity in presentation styles can be beneficial. Take a picture of the students’ list, and share it with the students.</p> </section> </section><br>   <br></body></html>
