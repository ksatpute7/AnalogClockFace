	                                   You will solve math stories to explore the relationships between multiplication and division and between addition and subtraction. You will then use these relationships to estimate, solve, and check the answers to math stories involving all four operations. You can write a single equation to represent a two-step word problem. Sometimes you will use parentheses to show which operation to do first. Other times you can use the order of operations. In some equations, you will use a letter, or variable, to represent the unknown numbers that you are trying to find.

 </header>
<p>
	                                   In this unit, students gain experience in solving two-step problems by using equations with the four operations—addition, multiplication, subtraction, and division. Although students have solved a variety of one-step and two-step problems, this unit focuses on allowing students to solve problems and learn how to represent two-step problems with one equation. During the process of solving a variety of two-step problems, students will be introduced to the order of operations and the use of parentheses in simple cases. Students will also learn how to check the reasonableness of an answer using the relationships between operations, number sense, and estimates.

<p>
	 <span class="strong">Solve problems involving the four operations, and identify and explain patterns in arithmetic.</span>
</p>
<p>
	 <span class="number">8.</span> Solve two-step word problems using the four operations. Represent these problems using equations with a letter standing for the unknown quantity. Assess the reasonableness of answers using mental computation and estimation strategies including rounding.<sup>3</sup>
</p>
 </section>
<p>
	 <sup>3</sup> This standard is limited to problems posed with whole numbers and having whole-number answers; students should know how to perform operations in the conventional order when there are no parentheses to specify a particular order (Order of Operations).
