Have students turn to the B page in <em>What is a Community? from A to Z</em>. Ask them to reread this page silently.</p></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Next, display 20 blanks and work with the students to fill in the 20 blanks (or fewer) as they summarize the text with you. The blanks should be filled in with their own words, but based on the reading. You and the class will negotiate as you fill in the blanks: which words are most important? Which can we leave out?</p></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Here is a sample Gist for the B page:</p><ul><li>All communities have buildings. The buildings come in all sizes and shapes. Buildings can be schools, churches, skyscrapers, and homes.

This time have students work in pairs or in small groups.</p></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Gist writing is a skill that will develop over time.

Provide support as they complete the procedure for letter C. When paraphrasing texts, encourage ELLs to use key words and short, simple sentences. Allow students to state their Gist orally, counting the total number of words in their home language before writing it down.

Students often want to use more words than necessary when writing a Gist.
