Others may be able to plan with a partner but may need help in getting their ideas down on paper, so they may need someone (partner, adult) to do the writing. Encourage struggling writers to sketch pictures while they wait to meet with you or another scribe. Students should leave Work Time with one set of actions on their planning sheet so they have a clear plan for writing.</p></div></div></div></div></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></section></div></div><script src="scripts/jquery.js">//</script>
