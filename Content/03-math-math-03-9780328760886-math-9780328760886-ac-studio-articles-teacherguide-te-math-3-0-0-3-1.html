	       Project the Hundred Chart tool, which is available in the Notebook.
</p>
<p>
	       Have students describe the patterns they see, and explain why they think each pattern appears the way it does. Some patterns that students should notice include the following.

<ul>
	<li>
	<p>
		       Numbers in a column all have the same digit in the ones place.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		       Numbers in a row all have the same digit in the tens place, except for in the last column. The digit in the tens place in the last column is 1 more than the digit in the tens place in the rest of the row because when you count up to 10 you make a new ten.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		       As you move to the right, the digit in the ones place increases by 1 until you get to the last column. The digit in the ones place in the last column in every row is 0, because you made a new ten. Conversely, when you move to the left, the digit in the ones place decreases by 1 (again, except for the number to the left of the last column). Check that students see that as they move to the right through the chart, they count by 1s.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		       As you move down, the digit in the tens place increases by 1. Conversely, as you move up, the digit in the tens place decreases by 1.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		       The numbers you say when you count by 10s are all in the last column.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		       The numbers you say when you count by 5s are all in two columns: the column with 5 at the top and the column with 10 at the top.
	</p>
	 </li>
	<li>
	<p>
		       The even numbers are in every other column (in the columns with 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10 at the top).
	</p>
	 </li>
</ul>
