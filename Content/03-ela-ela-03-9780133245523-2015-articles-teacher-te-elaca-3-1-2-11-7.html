Explain that some nouns are easy to identify, such as rocks, paper, and scissors, because you can see and touch these things. These nouns are called <em>concrete</em>. Explain that some things you can’t see and touch, like happiness or leadership, are also nouns, and that these nouns are <em>abstract</em>.</p></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Say to students:</p><ul><li>You just did some thinking, had a discussion, then wrote in your Reading Log. Is <em>discussion</em> concrete or abstract? What about <em>thinking</em>? What about the <em>Reading Log</em>? Only the Reading Log is concrete, because it is an object. (However, if students’ Reading Logs are on a tablet or other device, change the setup to “then you used your tablet [or name of device] to write something” and make the device name the third noun.)</li></ul></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>If time allows or more exposure is necessary to help students differentiate these types of nouns, play the Thumbs-Up, Thumbs-Down game, using words such as banana, toy, hope, lightbulb, truth, chalk, toaster, crime.</p></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Say to students:</p><ul><li>Let’s look at nouns that name some of the things we do and use each day.</li></ul></div></li><li class="content-list-item"><div class="content"><p>Ask the class:</p><ul><li>Is a feeling, like joy or loneliness, concrete or abstract?
