Cognates are words derived from the same origin or root word. Cognates are often spelled similarly in more than one language and they may also share similar meanings. If you have Spanish-speaking ELLs in your class, point out that the English word <em>community</em> and the Spanish word <em>comunidad</em> share the same meaning and are spelled similarly. Highlight that students can use their native language to help them understand the meaning of some English words. This is true for all of the focus words:</p><ul><li><em>provide</em> (English) vs. <em>proveer</em> (Spanish)</li><li><em>constantly</em> (English) vs. <em>constantemente</em> (Spanish)</li><li><em>situate</em> (English) vs. <em>situar</em> (Spanish)</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="amp ell" data-amplification-type="ell"><div class="col"><h3 data-proficiency-type="Expanding" class="proficiency-heading">Expanding <em class="standard-id" data-display="hidden" data-standard-id="P1.3.12">P1.3.12</em></h3><div class="amp-content"><p>The amplification in the Emerging level also applies for this level.</p></div></div></div><div class="amp ell" data-amplification-type="ell"><div class="col"><h3 data-proficiency-type="Bridging" class="proficiency-heading">Bridging <em class="standard-id" data-display="hidden" data-standard-id="P1.3.12">P1.3.12</em></h3><div class="amp-content"><p>The amplification in the Emerging level also applies for this level.</p></div></div></div></div></li></ul></div></li></ul></div></section></div></div><script src="scripts/jquery.js">//</script>
